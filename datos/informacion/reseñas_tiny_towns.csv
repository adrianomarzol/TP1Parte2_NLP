The only game I know of that plays equally well - and equally quickly - at one player, six players, or anywhere else in between. The solo game is quite different than the multi-player game but it's nicely done. A real brainburner considering it's a ""light"" family game. Theme is tacked on but cute, great abstract puzzle."

7,"This one falls into that “Smurf-and-write sans writing” category. It’s a game where each turn an option is revealed, and players simultaneously decide what to do with that option on their personal player boards. In my collection, Karuba and Draftosaurus are our go-to titles in this style for kids and non-gamers. Tiny Towns is a step up in complexity, presenting more options and lots of variability - but it’s still a rather simple game. The hook here is that players take turns being the “Master Builder” each round - a role that comes with immense power (and a tiny wooden hammer). When you’re the MP, you get to decide which type of resource everyone will get to use during that round, so you’re the only one at the table who is sure to be satisfied. This makes the game highly social, as players cry out in agony or practically weep with gratitude when you announce your decision. Obviously, things get increasingly tense as the game progresses and people’s 4x4 grids begin to fill up. Another aspect that makes this game addictive and intriguing is the manner in which resources are placed and then converted into buildings. You are tasked with matching the colored block pattern of your intended structure in order to manifest it, and then all the cubes you used are removed and the building is placed on the space where one of those cubes resided. As your board fills with lots of cubes representing different things you’re hoping to build, you need to pay close attention to which buildings you finish first to make room for the others that need more space to complete. It’s not easy to explain, but there’s an interesting spacial puzzle here, and a sense of major relief when you finish that one structure that’s getting in the way of everything else. Everyone begins the game with a private structure they will be able to build if desired, and each of these have unique rule-breaking abilities or ways of scoring points. Some of them seem to be a bit overpowered, though - there’s definitely a balance issue here. Another frequent weak spot is how the randomly selected menu of basic structures tends to present some scoring synergies so blatant that everyone at the table will be working on the same thing - but the power of your unique structure sometimes corrects this by incentivizing another route. It is also not uncommon for a player to get completely hosed throughout a game, which can put a damper on the mood. But ultimately, the gameplay here is breezy and fun, with lots of grueling decisions and big emotional moments. Production-wise, Tiny Towns is aces. Beautiful box art. An abundant and broad assortment of vibrantly colored wooden buildings and cubes. A perfectly executed rule book. Even an insert that actually does its job efficiently. No matter which way you turn this box on your shelf, it cries out to be played with its pleasing aesthetics."
8,"It's a fun, thinky abstract game. It plays quickly, usually with a little analysis paralysis built it. The expansions don't add anything necessary, I believe, except for the extra building options."
8,I describe this game as Tetris meets Catan for pacificists. A really fun game that is easy to play with a large group of people and casual enough to have conversations without having to be overly competitive or strategic.
7,"Fun game solitaire or with others, I see no dip in the enjoyment either way. Good game!"

7,A simple game on the surface but actually a lot more puzzle like on how you will fit your buildings in and get the materials you need. I think I would like it more with more playthroughs
8,"|+| Tight board space lends to difficult but fruitful decisions. Feels ok to get trapped. Analysis paralysis seems easy to avoid with limit of options. Variable setup and building simplicity makes widely replayable.
Well integrated expansions. Colorful, fun palette.

|-| Why is the box so big? Expansion or two could have been included in original design, as orig design sometimes feels a bit shallow."
7,"Jam city. Tiny Towns is a fantastic family game that helps highlight some of the awesome things that can come from modern board games.

The expansions add a lot to the game without a ton of rules overhead."
7.8,"Each turn one player called a resource, then everyone must put it in his/her board. You want your cubes on your 4X4 grids to match one of the patterns printed on the cards on the table so that you can build a specific building on that card. You also have your personal goal which is hidden from others until you build it. Easy to teach, enough meat, has a spatial aspect. You can also play with a town hall rules which we like better."
,"An otherwise simple game improved by a rather fascinating rule: players get to choose what resource everybody has to play.

The whole game, as far as I am concerned, is looking at other players' boards and calling out exactly the resource that will screw them over, while simultaneously trying your damnedest to avoid allowing your fellow players to do the same to you.

In the first few plays of this game my friends and I were routinely scoring three or more points per building. Once we realized how vicious the game can be, 2 points per building would be generous! Start playing ""defense"" and it's a whole new game.

In this regard, anyone who thinks Tiny Towns is ""multiplayer solitaire"" is either extremely new to the game or quite foolish - you cannot win this game if you aren't looking at everyone's town at once!

My copy came with a deck of cards so you can play Tiny Towns as a multiplayer solitaire game, but I can't imagine ever playing with it. I also doubt I would play with more than four players... and three is probably best. Higher player counts discourage thwarting individual opponents as other players will likely gain."
9,"Simple yet thinky trying to place all your buildings (cubes) on your board.

7,"Very good light/mid weight game. You can teach it in 5 minutes and it's pretty fascinating. Yes it involves a lot of luck, but its fun and quick and it doesn't make it feel bad."
8,"Each turn one player chooses a resource which all players must place on their relatively small town board. The goal is to match patterns and then replace the matched resources with buildings which score points according to various conditions printed on the building card. Instead of choosing resources they can be selected by drawing a random card, turning the game into a flip and write. I prefer to have a player choosing a resource as for the extra interaction it provides, particularly at lower player counts. There are a reasonable number of variables to balance whilst playing and decent variety in the set of building cards."
6,"Really nice puzzle game. Easy to learn, but lots to think about. In the same category as Sagrada, Reef, Azul, etc. This could end up my favourite; will need more plays to say for sure.

Revisiting this several years later and I'm lowering my rating slightly. I usually really enjoy these light puzzle games, but the master builder mechanic brings down the enjoyment."
7,"Brain draining, for sure, not sure how I feel about how fun it is

Tried it again with drafting, much better."
7,Very well designed and good at what it does. There's quite a bit of variability in the base game box and the expansions can add even more. It plays quickly once set up and lends itself to multiple plays in a row. Also works great for playing remotely!
5,"With many players i.e. 3+, especially relevant to those new to the game, you can get caught in a situation where you've dug a hole for yourself and are booted from the game, forced to wait for the rest of the players to finish."
7,"I honestly really like the game. The problem is, for new players, there is too much technical language and concepts where they will get confused, consult the rulebook, build wrong under poor assumptions, etc. There needed or needs to be some simpler cards or buildings OR you must play with players comfortable with reading board and card game language. If you are playing with players who are comfortable with that stuff intimately they may elect instead to play something more complex or more strategic. It's in a weird spot between complexity and playability imo"

8,"This game is just a perfect little puzzle. Each mode is great, everything is super cute, and it's easy to teach and highly replayable."
3,"Initial thoughts after 1 play... Played at 4 with our children and recommended first setup.

I enjoyed the early game of placing and planning resource cubes. The fact that you don't have to force-build provides some flexibility in between turns. I wasn't concerned with what others were doing until later on when it was more obvious what resources some players were going to call, and I tried to use that to my advantage.

Unfortunately, the late game felt like a coin toss due to both the limitation of space and the limitation of what others needed. Sadly, I feel like I've played games like this before. The reduction of mechanics paired with a variable player power (the monuments) generally leads to games being decided by that power. It will be interesting to play this a few more times and see how that hypothesis holds up."
7.5,"Soloable.

Tiny Towns is an attractive, medium light, bingo/flip and write/grid coverage game. It involves arranging cubes in polynomial shapes to then convert to 8 building types on a 4x4 player board which interact with one another for different action and scoring possibilities. It is easy to play, but difficult to master."
7,"Great game. Easy to teach with a decent amount of strategic depth. Great at high player counts as well as low. Lots of replayabilty, very happy with this game.

Edit January, 2025:
I think the game is good however, my tastes have changed and there are often other games i would rather play. like it, dont love it so its on the cull list."
4,Not really for me but I can see why others would enjoy!
10,Outstanding pattern building game that utilizes the shrinking space mechanism to create a lot of tension. Some nice available expansions expand the game and add variety. Quick playing at about 45 minutes. In my top 100.
5,"A surprisingly charming party or newbie game with a few strategic twists in timing and punishing those who time badly.

Sell price: 20"
6,"Tiny Tows is an interesting city placement game where the challenge lies in strategically placing building resources in order to maximize scoring potential. Also, the game does a great job of adding variety by having different buildings and monuments on each playthrough.

However, I felt like each turn was a solo exercise in optimization. I prefer having more player interaction or options."
6,"I bought this for something like $4 on a huge blowout sale, so the value for money was already there from the get-go. Super fun, basic placement game with some frustrating, agonizing decisions. Will probably never get the expansion, but at least I cut the base game box down to take up less space!

It's a nice filler that I don't often bring out but I'm happy to keep around. Not exceptional, but eminently approachable.

No player interaction other then blocking someone with you resource choice. I like the ratio of rule simplicity to decisions though decisions weren't heavy. More of an exercise of trying how to make an unwanted resource useful down the road. I started with the recommended cards but I'll switch it up to see if that improves the rating.

6.3,"This game is WONDERFUL! We love playing it. It has an awesome variant for beginning players to be able to keep two cubes reserved to the side at all times, which really helped keep the game competitive for us since I am lousy at spatial games.

The concept is very fun and the game is easy to learn. The variety of meeples and the gorgeous colors of them is awesome. The artwork is fantastic. The game feels different each time because of the variety of buildings, especially if you add in the expansion packs. We love it!"
1,"Boring bingo style VP optimization puzzle, I see no reason to return to this one as you've seen all the game has to offer on the first play."
7,"A very solid game in the roll and write family of gameplay styles except a player gets to decide on the roll every turn.

The problem with this game is that on the first few turns, you effectively need to digest all of the possible buildings in the game and create your game play very quickly, then just follow through. There is not nearly as much on the fly strategizing compared to the rest of the roll and write genre once you've played the game 2 or 3 times and know what you need to do in order to succeed.

But then on your first and second game players who don't click and feel regret for their decisions early on have a very very bad time, so it is very punishing in that sense as you get eliminated quite early if you don't know what you're doing."
9,"Cute family game that is quick playing. Simple rules, nice art and components."
8.1,"I've had the same frustrations others experience with this game.

It might as well have been given a Lovecraftian theme and called Cosmic Abominations instead of Tiny Towns. So, given the pleasingly colorful art, this needs to be said upfront: this ain’t a kids game.

Between every game, there are seven main facts of the gameplay that can change. These are the requirements and consequences of the seven buildings players will be building. Because of this variability and the spatial nature of the puzzle, the potential for AP is enormous.

But it's easy to make the game better, for solo or group play.

First, make sure the seven building cards you've selected have a fairly balanced distribution of resources. If you count four to six of each resource across the seven cards, you'll likely have a happier game.

Next, try the official Town Hall variant on page 6 of the rulebook. It may reduce interactivity, but it changes the vibe of the game to something a bit less punishing. You can also try removing some of the more complicated or difficult-to-build cards from play.

If you still struggle or want to make it more forgiving for new players, try the Cavern Rule (page 4). This lets you store two resources just off your board for later use.

Finally, especially with new or younger players, put aside the Monuments or agree to use a handful of balanced ones. The game is plenty interesting without them and can be very unbalanced with them.

I now play with the Fortune expansion. I like how the coins add a wild to the game. The cards integrate the coins nicely, but aren't necessary to try them. Download the expansion rules and try the coins using your own tokens: you earn a coin when you construct two buildings in the same round, and you can only keep up to four at any one time. You can spend them to use any resource on a turn.

My rating is mostly for solo play, but takes into account using some of the above tweaks. Without them, my rating would be a bit lower."
8,"I like optimization puzzles, and I like games with a lot of potential cursing at your opponents, but I didn't like the combination in this one. I think the pace was a bit too slow if you stopped to take your opponents into account, and a bit arbitrary if you didn't, making this much, much better at 2."

8,"This is the perfect game. Easy to understand and start playing. Very simple mechanics. But at the same time, i would argue that there is a high skill cap for this game. Once you know how to play and are more comfortable with the systems and the variety of buildings, you can engage in predicting oponents' calls and plan accordingly. You can also try to build your board in the right direction while simultaneously putting your opponents in a tough/awkward position. On top of everything I said, the game goes by fast so it's easy to play multiple rounds in one sitting."

If my boyfriend didn't absolutely despise this game, I think I would play it a lot more and enjoy it more because of it, but if it were to leave my collection, I wouldn't be devastated by any means."
6,Cutesie family level game that has so much variability with all the expansions. It's rare you'd ever play the exact same game ever which is cool. Not a game for the spacially unaware though. The non chiral nature of the block layouts can prove a brain burner for some folks.

8,"Prior to 2020: 3 plays

Some games manage to create incredibly compelling puzzles for the players to solve, and Tiny Towns is no exception to this rule. While the game can sometimes devolve into a bit of a solitaire puzzle at times (although, I'd argue that this is mostly due to poor play - good players will try to select cube colors that are ineffective based on what their opponents are trying to build their strategies towards), it's a puzzle that is immensely interesting and challenging to tackle correctly. It's a game that is incredibly punishing of players' mistakes, and one that forces players to both have strategic vision regarding the development of their board while also maintaining tactical fluency to adapt to cube draws that are less-than-preferred. It mixes ""polyomino"" style games with an economic engine, as so many buildings play off of each other and all are built via the placement of various cubes in a specific pattern. If there's one thing that makes me hesitate from giving this a higher score, it's the special buildings that players are given at the beginning of the game - I'm not sure their balance holds across all player counts due to some being much more reliant on more difficult patterns or scorings, which may not synergize as well with the types of buildings in play. I'd consider playing a variant where theres n+1 buildings (n = # of players) openly available to build at a first-come-first-serve basis. Even still, this is a reasonably minor complaint in an otherwise exceptional game of spatial puzzling, planning, and decision-making. A modern classic that I see myself continuing to play well into the future. Definite keeper."
4,"Kind of a roll & write with a bit more agency - players choose which thing they have to place each turn rather than it being determined randomly, so you can try to choose something more helpful to you than the others. Still not a genre I enjoy much though, especially in this case where doing remotely well involves doing spatial planning many turns in advance."
,Nice puzzly placement game. Polyomino style shapes that you place with resource cubes but only one square is taken by the final built piece freeing up space to build other buildings. The end game was strange. Players get to keep going when others have got stuck with a filled board but no legal buildings to create. People were waiting around while one player got to do many optimal moves to easily place buildings. A 6 or 7?
7,"Nephew's game. Simple spatial puzzle. Nice table presence but actually very abstract. Quick. Score can be wrecked in a blink. Fun and frustrating.

Last played 2024"
7,"Positive first impressions. Simple rule set, pretty quick, lots of thought. A good option to have in a collection but nobody seems to clamor to play it."
7,"Fun, sometimes mean, puzzle of a game. The buildings all having a unique power or scoring condition is cool and keeps the variety there with all the different combinations. Honestly though, this can be mean, play it in the right crowd.

Update: Enjoyed my time with Tiny Towns, but I seem to enjoy it more than most of the people I play it with. It's just time to move on.

Update 2: I miss playing Tiny Towns, my friends are wrong!!

Ideal Player Count: 3"
5,It was an okay game which obviously did not make much of an impression.
6,"City building filler game. One pattern card for each type of building is revealed at the start of the game. Each player gets a grid. In turn order each player calls out a color of cube, and then all players have to take one and place it into their grid on an empty space. Then if they have a grid state that matches a pattern on one of the cards they can clear the cubes and place a building token in one of the spaces those cubes occupied. To keep things from being symmetrical, each player gets one special building card to their hand which grants them a different ability or scoring opportunity once built. The game continues until everyone's grid is full of buildings or useless cubes. Then you score and are punished for spaces without buildings.

The game plays quickly, and it's quite satisfying to try and tetris these cube patterns while avoiding getting cubes stuck in an arrangement that won't be able to complete a pattern. Clever players can watch for colors you need and try and call out colors they can use but you can't to trip you up and also manipulate you into calling a color they need.

We had one oddity, there is one of the asymmetric cards which once built had the ability to let the owning player place a completed building anywhere in their grid rather than forcing them to place into one of the spaces those cubes occupied. This seemed a little overpowered, but perhaps with additional plays we would see it differently."
8,I just really like this game a lot. It's like Tetris with towns.
4,"At one point in every session I've had of this, I've looked around the table and was the only person with their head up, looking at anyone else. That should tell you all you need to know depending on your preferred level of player interaction. It's a nice little puzzle, but for me is akin to doing a Sudoku alone at home. Everyone just kind of says the score they got at the end, and you could easily go the rest of the game without saying a word. If a game actively drives down my engagement with friends or family, I'm not going to be a fan regardless of how clever it is."
8,"Super easy to learn/teach, but there are a lot of decisions to make."
6,An excellent family tittle that has some player interaction and table engagement from the bingo-style gameplay - but is ultimately still headsdown.
6,"7.5 - 4 plays - Very enjoyable game. Nice, quick, thinky puzzle. I really enjoy spacial puzzles and this hits the spot! Fairly easy to teach. I expect the varied scoring cards will keep one from falling into the same strategy every game. It has the same tension as Cascadia and Calico where you make plans but then have to pivot and adjust when less than ideal resources come into play. Very good tension throughout. Have only played at 4 so far with regular rules.

7.0 - Not feeling super drawn back after 8 plays. It's really hard to pull off a non-cottage strategy (even though they're supposed to be more powerful) which is unsatisfying. New players always just go for cottages which makes it even more difficult.

6.5 - 10 plays - Don't love this game, decisions feel a little too simple and it seems too easy to get screwed by the card draw, but Julie likes it so it stays in the collection."
8,"Played at a board game café, loved it, bought it same day! I like it a lot. My husband doesn't like it as much."
9.5,Was my top game of all time but still a fantastic game to bring to the table.
6,Wonderful abstract town building game. It’s quiet strategic at two and more chaotic with each added player. At higher player counts consider using the variant rules for choosing resources. Tons of variety and replay value in the box. Solid components that compliment a tight brain burner.
6.5,"Should be right up my street, but somehow the game falls flat. Just not enough happening, and in the later stages your options are very limited."
5,"Not certain I like this at player counts above four (the input chaos is extreme), or with the Mayor variant (player interaction completely disappears). It’s a cool game at 4 or fewer, but I’m not convinced I would select it over other games of similar depth at those player counts. It also takes up a lot of space for what is basically a chromed-out roll and write."
10,This one is one of my one true loves - such a fun one to play with large groups but also SUPER fun solo!

5,"In this game players will place resources on their tableau, and create different formations to form buildings. Once a building is formed resources making that shape are removed, and the building is placed on any square that had a resource. Buildings are scored based on adjacency or other conditions.

Pros:
- easy to learn
- need to be flexibl

Cons:
- multiplayer solitaire

Feels Good:
- puzzling out a great move, after being screwed of some resources

Feels Bad:
- miscalculations"
4,"A major disappointment for a game I thought Marie would love constructing the buildings in the town, but there were so few interesting decisions other than how will I try to score (which pretty much has to be decided before the game begins). Positive buzz for me on this one and it was just bad for us."
6,"Cute little game, but it can be frustrating with the standard rules at two. We're now trying the Town Hall rules to see how we get on.

Some of the monument cards can be really tricky, and if both of your options are difficult it can feel a bit daunting.

We also primarily play at 2, which I have a hunch might not be the best player count. I think the chaos of 3 or 4 people with different strategies might work better.

EDIT: Enjoying it more with the Town Hall rules at two, though it does mean some of the monument rules don't work and it removes some of the slickness. Upgraded from a 6 to a 7."
8.8,"I've played a few times over a single weekend. I was super excited about this one but it still sits luke warm for me. Perhaps it is more interesting with others, but I am playing solo. Jury is still out."
7,"Review:
A light and fairly quick city-building game which sees players try to best utilize space on their own boards by making resource choices on their turn and also having to implement the selections of other players. Variable buildings each game help to keep games fresh along with charming artwork.

Recommend 3-4 players

Good:
* Brisk turns.
* Watching city planning work out.
* Differing strategies each game.

Not so good:
* Feeling helpless when a mistake was made.
* Playing with 5-6 players without the Town Hall variant."
7.1,"+ Clever, brain-burning, multiple paths to victory. Spatial awareness.
- Unforgiving, downtime if your town fills up faster than others."
,FIRST PLAY: Place cubes in your 4x4 grid and convert them into different buildings to score points. Fairly light but agonising spatial puzzle. Multiplayer solo. 7/10
8,"I have mostly played this solo. Great little puzzle that I seem to appreciate more and more each time with the various combinations of building types.

Reducing from 9 to 8 due to the severe AP this causes me. You need to think very very far ahead."
7,4/16/24 - Changing my rating from 6 stars to 7 stars. I'm enjoying this much more than I did my first time through.
8,"Could be used as both a filler and a feature. Could be played lightly or with brain crunch. After one play it’s going to be a fixture in my boardgame bag. Enjoyed it that much. Short rule book, and goes up to six, which is great for any board game night with more than four."
8.5,"Incredible game. So simple to understand, yet sooo difficult to win lol. This is the epitome of elegant game design. There's a lot to think about despite how simple the game is."
,"Adorable, with stimmy pieces. Cute little woodland creatures (think Wind in the Willows) are building a town with very limited resources. You also have so little space to work with that you have to store your resources and build your buildings on the same tiny 4x4 grid.

+ Tiny Towns"
7.5,"Game category: counter placing

Really good game, gets harder as the game goes on as you run out of space."
6.8,"ok, this is ranked 87 as a family game... and rules are pretty simple... but boy on actual play this is much harder than it looks... I had to try to keep track of multiple buildings I had under construction at same time.

I also ended up being only player left who was still in play near end and so I had maybe a dozen turns all by myself where I just called out the building materials I wanted and built what i wanted that could fit.... that seems like a huge advantage?"

8,"Rating based on 2-player games so far. It's interesting, kind of a love child born from Quadropolis, Azul, and Karuba. It has more interaction than Karuba, which was way too solitary for my game group to get behind. The puzzly nature of the game makes it a fun little brain burner. We played an initial game without any monuments, just to get the mechanics down. The result was a game that felt a bit samey, like we were both building to the same strategy. Thus, the resource calls were pretty predictable. Then, we added in the monuments and the asymmetrical game play changed the resource calls completely, so that was nice! After getting comfy with the recommended start buildings, switch up the main building cards and it added another layer. So, right now it feels like an onion where you keep peeling back the layers. It plays quick and you do get that itch of ""let's go one more time"" when a game ends. Want to get more players in the mix to see how that goes, but so far it's a solid 7. My only gripe is the box size. My comment to my FLGS when I picked it up was ""Tiny Towns... in a not so tiny box"". If I keep this one, I may repackage this to a smaller box just to make it easier to get this in my bag for pub game night.

UPDATE 5/6/19: Got this to the table with 4 players over the weekend and it didn't go over well. In one game, a player dominated with a Greenhouse/Barrett Castle combo. In successive games, I was not having luck getting the cubes to go my way and it left a blah taste in my mouth as I watched the other players finish their towns as I totaled up my losing score. In the end, a couple folks at the table felt the game was more or less determined at the outset and played on rails. Dropping the rating accordingly. Doubt this one will stay in the collection.

Update 2024:
For some reason, maybe it was another content creator's video they posted or something... but I felt the need to revisit this release and try it again. And if ever there was an ""it wasn't you, it's me"" apology required, it's with this title. Reading my above review, I cannot help but feel like I was reviewing a completely different game. If it weren't for the specific mentions of Greenhouse or Barrett Castle, I would have considered that I reviewed the wrong game here. But, I didn't... and what I've realized is that this game is actually pretty darn good. I'm pegging it a solid 7 / B-Tier game for the moment. But it has room to rise. I'm adding the expansions here in the coming months via trade, so cannot wait to see how that influences my opinion. But as it stands, I'm looking forward to playing this more. This is truly a game that I couldn't stand 5 years ago that is really providing enjoyment today. Go figure."
7.5,A fast playing abstract game where you convert placed cubes into buildings. Cubes are chosen by the players and the puzzle is fitting them into a grid.
8,Backed the AEG Expansion Extravaganza Kickstarter campaign at the All in Bundle! pledge level.
7,"There's a lot to it. We have played several times and we still haven't ""graduated"" to playing all the card options. Looking forward to doing that, though."
8,"Have really enjoyed with 2, 3, and 4. It gets more chaotic with more players since more resources being called out are not your choice  A perfect example of ""funstration"". The puzzle gets harder and tighter as the game goes on and most of the issues you encounter are your own fault because of prior decisions. Haven't scratched all the different building types and combinations. Love the components too."
,"Best w/3, 1-5; Solo Recommended

Including:
+ Fortune + Larkstone
+ FLGS promo cards + Villagers

6,Not a great game but a decent one. I enjoy the gameplay generally but always feel like i'm one away from horribly losing in the worst way. Probably would recommend kingdomino over this.
4,"Owned it, sold it (thank goodness). I definitely did not enjoy this game. Hate depending on other players moves in such a limited environment. This game is lucky to be ranked as high as it is but I imagine it will lose its popularity over time."
7,"Of all the games on this list (so far) rating Tiny Towns is the hardest for me. What number do I put on a game I almost never win, sometimes am frustrated by, and yet still for some reason it appeals to me and I would almost always play if someone asked me to? It's weird! I can't quite wrap my head around this one. I like it, most days, and sometimes it is annoying, ha ha.

It's kind of like I WANT to like it more than I DO like it, and that desire makes me like it a bit more than I otherwise would! (Just writing about it has made me want to go play it again...)"
3,"3 feels low, but BGG's descriptive text is accurate for my rating. ""Bad - likely won't play this again."" My wife and I both felt this way. While there's some nice colorful art on the construction cards, the theme is completely unfelt when playing the game. It's just an abstract puzzle with a scarcity vibe. It could easily lead players to AP, I suspect, and the process just didn't have anything really fun about it, other than the times you trade in cubes for a construction."
7.5,I like the simplicity of the rules and the complexity of the puzzle. It also has great production value.
7.2,"Great little game, but had too many bits to take and play anywhere — so it hardly ever got played. Sold it."
7,A remarkably thinky puzzle that can be extremely frustrating and cause AP. Not what one expects from the title!
7,"Gorgeous game that can be either a fun family game, or brainburning puzzle depending on how you play. My friends who prefer heavy games kinda lost their minds around this somehow - so thinky, yet so simple. Card abilities can be a bit overwhelming at first, so this has a bit of a learning curve that may scare away non-gamers."
9,Great family game with enough depth of play for more advanced gamers.
7,"It's surprisingly cut-throat and frustrating for a cozy-looking game. Cartographers, which have literal goblins invading your map, is somehow more pleasant and chill. In addition to this theme mismatch, the idea of the game is more fun than the game, making this a 2nd place to Cartographers for me. Though I wish Cartographers would have similar components."
,Score points by using resources to build the most prosperous town. Up to 6 players.
,"The game is opened and organized, but has never been played."
6,"Excellent intro level puzzle game.
The rules are dead simple.
The complexity comes in the interaction (what do you do with colors called by other players) and the building variety.
Easy enough to be very accessible but interesting enough to be enjoyed by gamers. That is not easy to accomplish."
8,A neat resource placing game. You can easily run out of space on your board very quickly.
,"2023 July: Given free copy at Gem State Convention (Boise, ID) when we played it with comedian, Grant Lyons, who was hosting the game & taught us how to play."
7.5,"2.07 Complexity
Nice town building, decent replay-ability

7.2,"Good game of building a tiny town. Some buildings are overpowered, but if everyone realizes it and goes for the same buildings, scores are pretty close. The inclusion of monuments prevents all the boards from looking the same, so it is a necessity."
7.5,"Fun, quick game. Plays in 30 minutes. Cross between Dominion, Quadropolis and Tetris. Not for people who don't like spatial puzzles."
7,"1-6 players; 45 min; weight med-light.
As the game progresses, it gets more and more challenging to complete your buildings. It is a decent game, but wasn't quite as fun as I expected. I think it's because at some point, you will inevitably make a small misjudgement, and end up not optimizing your points. The game is fairly well balanced, and thus, regardless of your strategy, scoring is usually pretty close for evenly skilled players. I haven't played the solo variant yet, but it looks like it could be a very good solo game based on what I saw in a review."
7,"Want to play, but I have Reef, so maybe shouldn't get this?"
6,"Tiny Towns perfectly balances to the two strategic aspects of the game; planning and execution. Since the scoring combinations change each game, players must effectively parse the scoring opportunities and identify new synergies. They are then challenged to take advantages of these synergies and effectively execute their plan. Inevitably the player's will become trapped in a prison of their own making, and curse their mistakes from a few rounds previous, but in an manner that is enjoyable rather than frustrating. All of this comes wrapping in a highly accessible package and will engage players of various skill sets and experience."
8,"Have only played it a handful of times, but enjoyed it every time. People that are not good at thinking ahead and planning for random changes may get frustrated, but the game is fast enough that you can get multiple games in a night."
8.2,"No surprise, but the game is awesome. It's quick, simple and fun. You're making buildings by matching cube patterns on the recipe cards. It's a fun spatial puzzle and I think I like it better than Azul and Sagrada."
7,"More thinky than one would expect. Simple gameplay, easy to teach. Not sure it's going to make it to the table as much as I would've hoped."
6,A lot of people said they liked this game. I played it and it's VERY light. Yes there is some strategy but not enough to make me want to play it again and again. I'd rather play other games that give me a bit more. I would recommend Azul over Tiny towns any day if gateway or filler games is what you are after. It's visually bland in my opinion.
8,"This game is just a blast. It plays well at all player counts, easy to pick up and play, very fun socially at the table, and great for all skill levels. Will play this game any time it's out."
8,"This is a lot of fun. I like the puzzle of trying to build everything, while placing buildings that need certain cubes."
7.5,"First 2 plays under our belt. GF really likes the game, good brain game without being too exhausting. Like the building mechanic on top of an Azul-like engine. Looking forward to expansions."
7.5,"Simple, pattern and building. Satisfying if you can build at the right time, frustrating if not!"
6.5,Simple but thinky. Cards change and mix the game up which adds to replayability.
8,"Cute and fun. Requires some planning that can get squashed by other players' choices, but sometimes there is way out of the darkness."
,Got this for Jenny for Christmas! Looks like fun and came recommended.
7,"A nice solid game of placing cubes in attempt to build the best tiny town that will pay off and give you the most points in the end. Love all the bright cube colors that represent the types of buildings you are working on, and also love the turn aspect that forces other players to make their situations work based off of every other players turns too. Its puzzley and buildy, and I like that! Great choice!"
7.5,Very fun little puzzle game. Everyone seems to like it more than I do. Keeper.
5,"Not bad, just nothing that stands out for me. May just be personal taste."
7,Bingo with spatial building and a few twists. It’s the perfect opener.
7.6,Very enjoyable puzzle game with some nifty decisions to be made on such a small playing area. Fun with 2
4.5,follow the leader but super restrictive and not very good... there are now tons of better version of this game.
4,"pithy playtime
 diminished downtime
 bonny bits

 incidental interaction

I could be convinced to play this as a two player game, where I could potentially look across the table at my opponent’s board and care about what they are doing, so that I might then try to make choices that make their future choices more difficult. As is, because I don’t care what my opponents are doing while we play

Thankfully, the designer removed the dice, but unfortunately they also removed the central board, the blocking, and trading 

I'd rather play Medina"
7,"Spatial reasoning game where you're picking and placing resources on your grid to create configurations that allow you to build a matching building. This isn't really my favorite type of game (partly because I'm very bad at them), but I enjoyed the challenge and would play again."
7.5,"A wonderful little building roulette game with tetris mechanics. Very chaotic with 4+ players, so much so that I actually do not prefer it with any more than 4."
6.8,"The game is cute and the components are great. The concept is interesting but the game is very punitive and frustrating sometimes, since the resource you take is imposed by the first player. In the same category, I would recommend Shake that city, where the players have multiple choices."
,"Acheté les autocollants au Black Friday 2023 à La Pioche pour 15,39$ +txs."
5,The monument powers are unbalanced; especially if someone gets the place anywhere compared to score a few extra points.
7.5,"Great game, a bit same-y. Also, it takes more time to set up than it does to play for my group."
8,"+ Villagers expansion
+ Larkstone & FLGS promos

Rating based on (mostly) solo & 3 players.

A light and fast game, but with a difficult spatial puzzle. The interaction in this is low--much lower than I would normally like--but what interaction is there would become more important as one becomes more comfortable with the game. In any case, the puzzle was enough to keep my attention and create enough angst even without others messing me up!

For solo, I prefer playing with the Town Hall variant, which basically mimics a multiplayer game and so you're not really missing out on much."
8,"Solo play only, but I really like it. I say if anyone is a fan of games based around forming Tetris type patterns and scoring and getting benefits, this is a good match. In short, puzzley goodness. Yes, I join the choir of it. Still need to play multiplayer and and with expansions."
6,"This was a definite one play and done, the game just isn't for me."
8,"Puzzle it out or just relax and build stuff, it is fun ether way!"
6,"Each time I play this game, I like it less and less."
,"Gift. Also have 2 promo cards from AEG.
+ Fortune ($10)

6,"Simple resource gathering game to build a pattern with rotating cards that determine the end game points, kind of Cascadia-ish. Didn’t really enjoy it all that much after one play- just wasn’t all that fun for me, and was more abstract than the art/tokens led on, but may adjust after playing at other player counts!"
9,Really like this game. - played at 2 to 6 players…. All good.
7,"Not much to sink your teeth into or leave you wanting more, but it's fun and the endgame is surprisingly challenging. Plus, the barrier to entry is very very very low. Minor ding for being visually boring at the start."
6.5,"Another nice little optimisation puzzle, with a good array of replayability from the different building cards."
5,"Completely innocuous title. You're simple calling out a cube color and everyone places down that piece. Form them in the right shape and you can build a building into one of those spaces. The game starts off easy, but your board quickly becomes clogged, especially if you have to place a cube of a color that you don't want. A lot of the cards score points off each other.

I'd certainly play it again, but I'm not going to go out of my way to suggest it. I think with 5-6 players the game would be far too hard to plan. 3-4 seems to be the sweet spot."
7.3,Classic easy to learn difficult to master game. This game frustrates you (in a good way) by never letting you get comfortable with a specific game plan.
9,"A wonderful town-constructing, grid-covering, pattern-building game that teaches and plays very quickly. The various building type configurations, personal monument goals, and game modes are sure to keep this feeling fresh for a while. Peter McPherson's design is elegant and puzzly, and I really enjoy the warm and friendly artwork. The production quality from AEG is also (unsurprisingly) outstanding. Fans of abstract, pattern-building, spatial games such as Azul and Sagrada should love Tiny Towns. Highly recommended for family and solo gamers, but do not let the cute artwork deceive you into thinking this is a simple game!"
7,"The simplicity of the game and the simultaneous play initially won me over. I also tend to like games with a lot of variable scoring conditions (which this has thanks to the number of buildings). But the more I played, the less I enjoyed it. The options become tighter as the game continues, which is an interesting dynamic to manage but not particularly fun. I also since discovered other drafting games with end-game scoring that was more interesting. And although they may lack the simultaneous play, they have more player agency."

Tiny Town is a nice little game of area planning with a touch of evil in it that will please many gamers. Plays quickly."
5,"It's fine, pretty well made but easy to get cornered in that you end up not caring or just hate drafting. Wish the map board was bigger"
,It's cute. My friends didn't want to play it; my wife said she'd try it but it never got to the table. Sold to make way for other games that would get played.
3,I wanted to like this game - I know that people liked it quite a bit and I usually like games like this. But there was a lethal combination of boredom and heavier rules load than I was expecting. It all felt clunky and aggravating.
7.5,"Grew on me. Lumpy, thinky, pretty, enjoyable and I'm not that bad at it lol. Looking forward to the expansion, anticipating my rating to rise!

Google AmassGames for videos"
7,"This is the kind of game I want to enjoy but seem to do very poorly at. Deceptively challenging to manage your small grid while trying to leave room to build and place buildings to combo rewards and points. More plays could lead to this 7 rating going up or down, but a nice product and easy to learn."
9,This game wrecks me with AP but it's still so good! Yet another staple in my household
7,Abstract puzzle game in which players deploy resources simultaneously into specific formations that become buildings when completed. Players must use foresight and think several moves ahead. Space is limited and players must avoid wasting resources. Immense replay value found within the buildings which can be randomized each session. Very accessible to all! Great game.
7.3,this is like 'ah shit' the game. i love when i realize i've screwed myself. VERY big feelings of 'ok go again' when this wraps up
5,Reminds me of phone games like 2048 and the whole genre of match stuff on a grid to build. I appreciate that Tiny Towns has a variety of different buildings from game to game.
6,A game I like to bring out to teach people who are getting into board games and are ready to start going past games like catan or ticket to ride. My favourite part is always how people realize four turns in how to play and how screwed they are from their initial decisions lol. Kiwi also enjoys playing this game
9,"Currently played five games with 2-3 people
Games is very engaging and feels quite deep and varied
Has enough simplicity it can be taught in a short period so good for off the cuff nights (as was tonight)

5,"Had played at two with just my husband and I enjoyed it more than he did. Has always been on our minds to maybe sell one day but I wanted to try it with more people. Have played at two with and without the ""bingo"" style variant. Finally played with 4 and we did not use the ""bingo"" style variant. Really did not enjoy it at all at a higher player count. Also realized how small the grid really is and how incredibly difficult it really can be to get a decent score just based on one wrong cube placement. Really wanted to like this, super cute and nice components but finally just gave it away."

7,"This is a really fun game. Nice components, great variety of player counts, thought provoking without being overly complex and a nice bit or replay-ability. It has a nice mix of strategy and tactics to it without taking it self too seriously. Very nice design."
5,"I've been very fortunate to have been playing such good, quick, simple games lately. Tiny Towns is a game in the puzzly solitaire-ish simultaneous play category (think Karuba). Each turn the lead player chooses a building resource that each player will place somewhere on their board. Players need to place resources in the shape of various building plans (plans are chosen randomly at the start of the game and shared/static throughout the game). When a player has placed resources in the desired shape, at any time, the player may reduce the shape into the building - placing the building permanently on any one square of the shape and thus freeing up more space for the player. Buildings have special abilities and scoring opportunities. Players each also have a unique monument only they may build and which they may build only once

Play is fast and breezy but surprisingly not devoid of interaction. You may need stone and brick but the other players keep giving you wheat - which you have to do something with. Your free space available will fluctuate throughout the game but will ultimately converge to zero thus it is very important to plan and pace your buildings. In addition, knowing what other players are trying to do could be crucial; why choose a brick over a stone on your turn if you know your opponent needs two bricks? Additonally, how you reduce your resources into buildings is critical as you need to make sure you'll still be able to fit the shape of the next building you need. Scoring opportunities range from simple multipliers to adjacency to majority scoring to scoring buildings only if they are ""powered"" by other buildings. There is a big stack of cards too which means every game will be different

At two players I think this had a little bit too much control for me. Being able to influence the decision of 50% of the resources means you can build pretty much exactly what you want without much trouble. I think three players would be the sweet spot as it would force you to cooperate just a little bit. At higher player counts I think you'll need to use the alternate resource card variant to keep the game from being total chaos

Tiny Towns is a pretty brilliant design. It is puzzly and breezy but it still has enough bite and variety for gamers. It might not be your cup of tea if you only like very heavy games but I found it deeper than the look of it makes it out to be. It is simple enough for the family, tricky enough for gamers, fast enough for a weeknight, and noncomative enough for couples (without being completely uninteractive). Great game that I think can only get better for me

EDIT: Tiny Towns presents a good efficiency puzzle and is one of the best uses of Bingo mechanics I've seen. After a couple of plays it feels like you are doing more or less the same thing every game though"
3,"This game is just not to my taste. I don’t enjoy the game design or mechanism at all.

The element of luck with the card draws and resource selection is unfair. One or two wrong placements on the board and it can leave you unable to recover, and only able to chose suboptimal placements. A player who is lucky with early placement selection will almost always have a much higher score."
8,Received at 2023 PNW Game Swap as a side trade for a copy of Elder Sign.
10,Previously owned two copies. You can just keep adding more boards as you add players; the game scales infinitely.
10,"This game is easy to learn, and has moderate difficulty to master. I love it and I'm hooked."
8.4,Really great little puzzle. Always a fun one to pull out.
5,"It's kind of a flip and write but you take turns dictating what the ""flip"" is. No particular aspect of this game is that interesting to me but the interaction is a bit more there than in games of its ilk. On the negative side, that interaction can feel somewhat one-dimensional, or like unintentional screwage."
,Has stickers I bought on Etsy that really make the game pop on the table.
8,"Pretty sure I'll never win against my wife at this game, but it's a great time all the same."
9,"This game is brilliant! Played it 4 games in a row against my girlfriend, lost each game, and I still think it is a lot of fun. The game is very simple to learn with difficult decisions to be made as you play, especially as there is less and less space to work with on your board. A must have in any collection."
6,"I am really unsure how I feel about Tiny Towns, but I think I lean towards it being a game I'm not interested in.

There are parts of it I like--trying to plan out your placements while remaining flexible with what colors others are putting down is an intriguing puzzle.

But then, I really dislike how chaotic and out of control things can seem--if your opponents start calling colors you don't need, it can just completely kill one's game. And perhaps with more time and practice it will be easier to predict what others are doing and so one can play into that better. But that seems a bit tricky to get good at.

The other part I really dislike is that because of the above type of thing, players who have more space have more flexibility, so there is this weird drive to try to use more cubes on making ""large"" buildings so that your town becomes full less quickly, and then you're more likely to drive your opponents out of the game first, so now you'll have more of your turns to call the colors you need, possibly getting to take the last several turns just by yourself which seems an extra nice boon in this game.

I really dislike those elements. Ultimately the game feels a bit too out of control for me, where I'm not convinced good play really matters as much as just kind of getting ""lucky"" in regards to starting down and playing out a strategy that doesn't get disrupted by opponents and instead jives with what they are and will do.

Update (July 2023): I'm still kind of unsure how to rate this, but I've now played a decent number of times over several years, so that's kind of a rare feat in of itself.

Overall, I'm moving the rating to a 6. There's some smart parts of this game and I do find myself wanting to play it once or twice a year which falls in line with a lot of what else I rate a 6.

There certainly is more skill than I granted above in learning how to be flexible in layouts and take advantage of things, but especially at the higher player counts, there's still this kind of general variance and unknowiness that leads to individual play mattering, but somewhat being outweighed by just a generally of how the players collectively let the game break and who emerges from that. Furthermore I think the various special buildings are kind of way out of whack, and so hoping to get dealt a good one is a bigger deal than it should be.

Ultimately though the game has some interesting choices, presents a fun spatial puzzle to solve for, and plays fast enough to make the whole package interesting for the rare game here and there. The main downside, and the reason I can't imagine ever rating this too much higher, is that it's also a very heads down game, with no central shared action, everyone is mostly calculating out their own stuff, and only occasionally will look up to try to figure out what cubes are coming next, or what call would mess up others. (Which to be clear, I'd rate this far far lower if you play with the deck of cards randomly deciding cube colors and not the players picking on their turn what color cube)"
9.4,A disaster mitigation city builder game disguised as a gateway family game. I was very hesitant to even try this game as the color scheme they chose for the main board and pieces really bounced off of me but I'm glad I did. It's a tricky little puzzle that has a lot going for it. The tactical decision when it's not your turn to think turns ahead and decide where yet another piece of wood would hurt the least is great and it's certainly a hard game to master. Solo variant is pretty decent as well although I feel like a die roll every other turn (when you're not choosing the resource) would feel more fitting to how the game actually feels.
7,"Starts out easy, but quickly gets very tight and you can very easily run out of moves, which may be a negative for many people. Make sure to plan ahead as best as you can. An interesting puzzle for those who don't mind not having all their plans come to fruition."

6,"I admit, when I first played this game, or first 3-4 plays I hated it. I felt it just failed immediately.

7,"Puzzle game with some interesting choices. Being too short sighted can cost points, but not watching short term can end your game quickly. Everything is meaningful."
4,Not good at high player counts. It might be better at solo or 2 player. But with my group we have too many players.
4.1,Very dry but stronger than many other roll-and-write-style games. Also relatively strong among solo games.
7,"Straightforward gameplay, place cubes to make patterns that let you construct point-scoring buildings. Not particularly interactive but there are opportunities to screw other players. Plays up to 6, which is cool.

7,Smart family+ style game. Nice family style production. Can be a step too far for children and those completely unfamiliar to designer games. nice variability in the box with the different building cards.
8,"The game when I first bought it was played constantly. And multiple people we played it with went out and bought it themselves. It is complex enough to satisfy a heavy gamer and it is easy enough to teach to even newer players. These days, it doesn't get the most play time, but it is still pulled out every now and then and smiles are had all around."
6.5,Nice thinky lightweight euro. Can be a touch frustrating and punishing: it’s no fun being out and watching everyone else wrap up their excellent towns
7,"Really solid, fun game. It's really easy to learn and teach, but it is still challenging. It has excellent restrictions that keep it interesting. I love the variability in how each game uses different ways of scoring buildings. It is a pretty quick game. Nothing about it blows me away, but it's good!"

Abstract Strategy

End Game Bonuses
Grid Coverage
Pattern Building
Solitaire Game

A group solo game.
Individual player boards with no interactions.
Place the randomly drawn color resources cubes on your grid with the goal of creating the pattern and colors needed to build scoring buildings/structures.
Some buildings scorings are independent.
Some need other buildings to score.
Others need proximity to other types.
Build your larger desired buildings first or you won't have the footprint in the later game.
Good idea to build structures of different color combos so you always have options."
7.5,"Despite the variability in terms of buildings, the game gets stale pretty quick.

It is still a great casual game and the high player count is appreciated and doesn't really impact game time which is a big plus."
7.4,An abstract game where you re trying to maximize space while being forced to put resources in your town that take up that space. There is a wide variety of combinations with this game some of which can really feel like its beating you down. The artwork does not represent the game play at all. I'm not even sure why there are animal -people on the box. I'm still up in the air how I feel about this one.
8.3,"Being fairly new to the hobby, maybe it’s just the type of games I’m drawn to, but this is yet another in a long line of games I like that’s almost more puzzle than game. Maybe it’s just coming from video games to board games it’s more noticeable to me. I like puzzles and I like Tiny Towns. It’s a good puzzle. It might even be a great puzzle. But after the wrapping comes off, it’s still mostly a puzzle.

I am drawn to wanting to play again which is always a good sign."
6,fun game with simple rules that makes you feel really stupid. Would recommend to play with draw deck for builder.

6,March 2023: played at boardgame club for the first time. Liked it more than I expected to! Had to think quite a bit about where to place cubes- the board gets crowded quite quickly! Will play it again but I don’t need to buy it at the present time. And I kept confusing it with Little Town!
6.5,"One paly only.

Fun spatial puzzle driven by neat cube selection mechanism in which each player selects a colour of cube which all players must take and place on their grid with a view to converting patterns of cubes in different colours into specific buildings which when placed are fixed.. At first that's easy, but when your board fills up it gets progressively harder- in our game, the player who was able to keep populating her board after everyone else was stuck won easily."
5,A clever spatial puzzle that scales very well - but it’s all so restricted that the challenge is more frustrating than enjoyable. It’s also a very big box for a game that essentially boils down to placing cubes on small boards.
6,"A set of randomized cards identifies the various arrangements of resource cubes necessary to construct various buildings in a 4x4 grid. Players take turns choosing which resource to acquire, but the chosen resource must be taken by all players, so it becomes a neat little spacial puzzle where everyone is trying to construct buildings that work well together to generate VPs, without getting bogged down with resources they cannot use."
7.5,"I like polyomino games. This had a variable setup with variable building powers/scoring to build your town. Good game with accessibility vs strategic depth.

One issue I didn't care for is being restricted to placing a building being called out by others, especially in a six player game, which caused too much havoc later in building my town. I read variants and expansions will mitigate/reduce this issue and will need to try that for future games."
6,"Beautiful looking game on the table with really nice components. The gameplay has a really strong spatial mechanic. Players are trying to create patterns to later change into buildings that score. I like that every game has different scoring cards, adds replay value to each game, but the game feels kind of chaotic. The cubes drawn and placed can really come back to haunt players. I'm willing explore more as it is a quicker playing game and perhaps I'll grow to like it more."
6,"The base set of building abilities all are fun and synergistic, but some combinations of building powers and especially monuments seem completely unbalanced and, honestly, untested, with how ridiculous they make the game state. At least it is quick so it isn't too offensive.

Update: I hate house ruling stuff but I just started taking the worst monument out of the pool every game and have only had positive experiences since.

Update again: Dropping to a 6. I find the solo game boring. 2-player, which is the main way I play games lately, is only slightly less boring, but doesn't really work at all. And if I have 3 or 4 or 5 players, there are many other games I'd prefer to play at those player counts. It is... fine. Game still looks great, though."

2.5,An incredible letdown. I don't understand how this one is popular at all.
3,"This and a series of other games makes me question whether I actually enjoy Polyomino mechanics. Jury is still out on that, but with this game, it was a huge misfire."
4,"I bought into Tiny Towns off of the theme and the art - thinking it would just be a really fun game to play on any casual day.

The game consists of taking turns naming a resource, and then putting that resource cube on your 4x4 city board. Once you make the same pattern of resources of one of the building cards, you can switch all those cubes out for a building meeple. Each building has its own end game scoring which can be fun. And that's basically it.

I felt that the board lacked enough space to really start making a city that felt substantial, and towards the end of the game all you can really do is make the same small building over and over again because you don't have any more space on the board. So the end game can become very drab and boring.

I think this game is fine, but not something I really have any desire to play again. I can see kids playing it mostly."
6.5,"Quick little game that has a lot more depth than what you see at first glance. One I look forward to trying again soon, but it probably says something that it doesn't hit the table very often with us."
7,"Good, but I'm bad at it. Would like to try using cards to pick the resources."
6,"Fun little game, very quick. Lots of different combos of buildings and they are each quite unique. Not much to say about this game. Fun, simple, and quick."
7,"This is clever, if a little raw and hard to win once a mistake is made. I'm not sure if I prefer with or without monuments – I love variable powers, who doesn't? and yet they also mean I might pick weird stuff other people can't use because it's straightforwardly GOOD for me, rather than because I am griefing them. Everyone having exactly the same conditions of struggle is a definite plus when playing without monuments."
4,This game just didn't do anything for me. Plays well with 2 people
7,"Pros:
+ Building is a clever puzzle
+ Quick play time
+ Variety of building so no two games play out the same

Cons:
- High variance with player selection of building blocks
- Some rounds can go especially poor for players"
6.5,"only soloed, quick to setup and tear down, feels a little lacking on decision making, and too light for me."
6,A fun resource management city builder game with a lot of deceptive strategy to it. One of the better games in the genre for sure.
6,"Tiny Towns is a fine game, but ultimately not something that is very exciting to play. It's quick and fairly simple to understand, but for what is essentially a filler game, it takes up too much space and lacks the punch we would want from something in short timeframe. AEG has trended towards these types of games, but the market has become increasingly saturated with them. Considering that, Tiny Towns just doesn't ""do"" enough to warrant a spot in our library."
10,"Such a great game. The fun of building a town in a simple game. Throw in the complications caused by what other players pick, and its a great game for large groups."
7,I like the concept of this game... but I am not good at it. I think it benefits from higher player counts.
8,"One of my new favorites, I'm constantly surprised by how much variety and strategy is hidden in such a simple game.

Tiny Towns is all of my favorite things about various board games rolled into one: it's easy to learn, quick to setup, tactile, strategic (but not overly cutthroat,) and plays in 30-60 minutes."
,"Best with 3, Plays 1, Plays 2, Plays 3, Plays 4, Plays 5, Solo, Playtime 45-60 minutes, Box Size 295x295mm,"
7,"My partner and I really enjoy this game and usually play 2 player. It's a great puzzle game with a cute theme, and doesn't take very long to play which makes it easy to break out on a week night after work.

The reason I deducted stars, is that thematically I think it would make sense for the game to give incentive for players to build multiple building types. Often some of the buildings are worth an incredible amount of points if you build multiple and so it makes sense to rush to build as many of those as possible, whereas some other buildings are only ever going to be worth a few points. Given the theme of building a ""tiny town"" there should be some sort of bonus or mechanism to obtain points for variety which would provide more incentive to build some of the other buildings that are worth less."
8.8,the simple complexity is growing on me more and more. seems like a basic game until you really get to the end rounds and realize you have to plan early for the sabotages coming.
7.5,"Great welcoming game. Bingo style, building a town in patterns of various resources. Can be mean at two players, but also there's a variant that makes it less interactive if wanted."
6.5,"Good game, replayable, easy to learn. Would love to see something other than blank colored cubes and boring artwork, but its fun none the less."
6.5,"Great game especially for large groups, this one comes out work work game lunches often."
6,"I think this is a solid game, but it didn't hit for us. I think we may have too many spatial/tile laying types of games."
,"build different buildings in your 4x4 grid by constructing patterns of cubes. the game is very simple. when it is your turn, you simply call out one of the 5 resources and everyone has to take that exact resource and place it on their board. each building is constructed with a different pattern of cubes and gets you points in different ways.

for 1-6 players, 10-15 mins to learn, 30-45 mins to play

great game for game night"
6,"Played Cascadia...then realized that I would never play this instead of Cascadia. Same scratched it, but Cascadia is much better and smoother"
8,"Having read many good reviews over the months since it's release & with player count from 1-6 this seems a perfect fit for my group.
Update: sold to friends who really enjoyed it as my cupboard was full!"
6.5,Picked up from AEG Black Friday. Nice gateway game. Not exactly my cup of tea but family liked it quite a bit.
8,So cute and fun to play! Need to bring it out more often.
6,"Not my type of game, but good to have in the collection to play with my casual gamer family."
5,Just a bit dull. Some of the cards that come out don't even seem that balanced as their are buildings that just really aren't worth building.
8,"A very good puzzle, but the game is MADE on two things:
- The different secret individual monument cards
- ""Calling"" a resource rather than just flipping it from the deck

Those make it so it's not everyone playing the same optimization over and over. The different resources provide different value when people are focusing on different building types with different tempos. Really clever."
7.5,"I wish I had taken the plunge for Tiny Towns when it first came out as I would’ve enjoyed it and played it even more back then. Don’t get me wrong it will still hit the table plenty, but I know this would’ve been a big hit had I owned it earlier in my board gaming adventures. - Read my review: https://boardgamereview.co.uk/game-reviews/tiny-towns-review..."
8,Great crunchy puzzle which plays well at high player counts and bellies cute theme.
7.5,"A nice, think-y puzzle for how short it is. Player interaction comes from trying to time your resource picks to give your opponents trouble."
7,"It's another one with little player interaction (unless you really want to slow the game down), but the puzzle is fun."
7,"Solid gameplay. Very little downtime. Good planning gout where you want to put your cubes on the board. We usually like to put some sport of time limit and I'm talking maybe no more than 15-20 seconds after somebody has said a resource, so the game can keep moving, plus it adds a bit of tension. Solid game. Very easy to learn and some variety as well."
6,"I played this game a bunch solo, and it was just OK. It can be VERY frustrating at times, especially near the end when nothing fits and you end up with a ton of empty spaces for negative points. That's not an enjoyable experience. Also, the solo game is heavily dependent on remembering the sequence of cards in the resource deck, and that's not something I'm interested in investing the mental power in.

It turns out to be more fun multiplayer, especially with more people as then you have less control over what resources come out. And I find that puzzle more enjoyable, trying to figure out what to do with resources that someone else calls that you don't need."

7.3,"Tight little resource drafting game with pattern management. Family friendly styling of cards with nicely shaped wood components. Player mat is made of thicker cardboard. I wish the cards were made of a thicker matte material.

Players build until each person cannot. This feature lets more experience players build their ‘town’ even though other players may finish first.

Great for couples and families who like puzzles. The resource/pattern management is too complex for kids."
9,"Enjoyed this way more than I expected I would, just looking at the box. Lots of interesting choices and special planning. Definitely want to play again!"
7.5,Clever little abstract town building game - good mix of control and chaos with four players.
6,"Meh. It's ok. Not bad, but nothing to get excited about either. We don't get it to the table very often."
3,"Eh, it was kinda alright. But not something I ever want to play again."
6,"Solo Rating: 7.5

This works very well as a solo game as a beat your own score affair. And if you start finding it too easy you can always play using the ""Town Hall"" rules to make it more challenging.

Recommended player count: 1-6

I would probably only use the ""Town Hall"" rules when playing with 5 or 6 players.

Comments:

The one three player game I've had was a surprising amount of fun. Done and dusted in 45 minutes including setup and teaching time.

Mostly I've played this solo and have enjoyed it very much so far. The main difference in multi-player is that you're more likely to have some unwanted resource foisted upon you. All part of the fun.

Why I got rid of it:

The core game play began to feel a little stale for me and I disliked the fact that some types of builds just seemed to be not worth bothering with most of the time. Some element of balance was not quite there."
6,"Solitaire puzzle akin to railroad ink. Like this more than railroad ink but it isn't terribly deep, seems pleasant enough to play in low doses."
6,"Perfectly fine game that I am happy to play, but I do not need to own."
8,"Very accessible to every gamer, deep enough to keep interest, and a fun 30-45 minute filler. It plays best at 3-4, while solo play, 2 player, and 5-6 players are all still good. Great game overall! Would recommend it if you like Azul."
7,"Each player has a tiny grid board. Player's take turns being the master builder who gets to pick which color of cube everyone has to add to
a square on their boards. After the cubes have been added if any players declare they have the correct pattern of cubes on their board matching one of the building cards in play, they can remove the cubes and add the matching building to one of the squares just emptied. Each of the building scores points at the end of the game in different ways. Examples are the cottage scores 3 points if it is fed, a farm feeds up to 4 cottages, a factory scores no points but can give you flexibility of what cubes you add, wells score 1 point for each adjacent cottage... When all your spaces are full of buildings or cubes and you can't build a building your game is over. Remove all the cubes you still have left and all empty spaces are -1 points. I've been liking this game and have still only played with the starter building cards. Most building types have 4 different similar buildings you can have in the game so looks like there will be some good variety. Also, each game everyone gets one special hidden building that they can build only once... so that also adds variety.

from my blog..."
,As a city planner I would like to play this game!
7,"A very fun building, tetris syle game. There are building powers that keep the game fresh. Love pulling this bad boy out for some quick-intermediate level gaming."
6.5,Decent abstract with some great art. Love the mechanics and bingo style resources. Tense towards the end. Plays quick but can slow down with the wrong group. Keep it simple and don’t turn this into a brain burner for fun.
5,"Ultimately disappointed by this. Was a fun, brain burning puzzle type of game that can get very frustrating if you make a mistake and block yourself. Luckily it plays pretty quickly so you can always count a game as a wash and them play again, but it stinks to watch others keep playing when you boxed yourself into a corner. Some of the special buildings are way over powered, while others are nearly worthless. Some of the basic buildings were never built, so maybe I missed some of the strategy, but it felt like we often just all built the same basic things in different places on our boards unless our special building was particularly valuable. Then that person usually won because of their special building. Nice components and potential to be a fun puzzle game that you could technically play with any number of people if you had enough boards, cubes, and buildings."

3,"Wow, this went over like a lead balloon. In our first 2 plays of the game I think I had at least one person say they genuinely hated the game. It feels so restrictive because of the limited space you have to play, and with people selecting what material you play each turn, you have to rely on someone else wanting the one thing you need, which is annoying. The scoring of the different buildings isn't unique, and didn't make the game interesting. I tried 4 times because I wanted to believe that I was just missing something, but it's clear the game is not for me. It feels light and simple as if you could play it with anyone, but that doesn't make it fun."

3,"There’s something here but it just wasn’t very interesting. Potentially broken per the rules as written in the sense that, if you start the game as master builder and I copy you without any deviation, we tie, I win."
5,"It's rather pretty with nice wooden bits and colorful graphics, and very accessible for any audience. But I find both the bingo mechanic and the increasingly constricted pattern laying dull and there's very little else to it."
5,Average - not many good decisions to be had for a light family game
6.5,"Not too bad, but not one of my favorites. It's more challenging for me, planning for how each shape will shrink down."
8,"Played Tiny Towns probably 5-10 times with a variety of player counts.

Tiny Towns is a clever game about managing limited space and planning your growth as best you can with limited control. The mechanism where one person picks a resource and everyone has to take that resource is fun and feels interactive. This is a game that can be enjoyed by everyone from novice to enthusiast. And the fact that it plays up to 6 players means it can even fit in as a party game.

I think Tiny Towns is a great family-weight game that can be enjoyed by many and is a good all-around game. Definitely a keeper."
6,"Grabbed this during the Target sale because I had been tempted before and remembered several good reviews over the past few years. Really like the concept and look of the game. Great production.

The puzzle is just so restricting. You start with high hopes then inevitably end up with a deflating feeling. I played the solo mode which I appreciate for the decision-making of selecting from three resource cards each turn, but even then, each game felt very swingy. Once I strung together a pretty high score, but usually I'd end up with a mediocre ending due to so many uncompleted spaces.

Probably won't hold on to it for much longer. Darn."
6.5,This game was a challenge in efficiently using the colors to place the buildings in spots that would not block your attempts to make future buildings! I really enjoyed it even though I lost.
8,"A really good game. You can really frustrate people with certain tactics but it is a thinky,fun game that offers something different. Nice production to"
7.8,I like this as a gateway type game or one that is light but still feels thinky. Quick to play Bingo style play that fills a s pot in my collection - essentially shorter games with meaninful decisions.
2,Not intuitive for new players. Not a very good gateway game but also not a lot of depth for experienced players.
8,"A very easy to learn game that has a good amount of depth in my opinion. The components are nice wooden buildings and cubes that are colorful and appealing. Currently all members of my family (myself, wife, two teenage boys, and a nine year old girl) enjoy the game and request to play it - I think that says a lot about its broad appeal.

Building types change from game to game to keep things fresh which is important, because otherwise I think it could get stale. It plays fast, which is a nice breath of fresh air between longer heavier games. I also like the fact it plays between one and six players, and is a relatively inexpensive game considering all the wooden components.

I highly recommend this game."
5,"Clever design, but claustrophobic. We played with 5 people and I didn't have a good view of the goal cards which was a substantial handicap."
7,An elegant visual puzzle with subtle player interaction and lots of nuanced variety. A deserved hit for AEG.
7.5,"2021 Rank: #77 [-17] : I'd like to see what the expansions bring to the table, but this simple looking game really puts the screws to you as you go along. It gets really tight late."
7.5,Intriguing little puzzle that has multiple knock on effects for all actions.
8,"Difficult to say how much lasting appeal this will have for me, but it made a good first impression."
5.5,"UPDATE 2022: Played 2 more times. Nobody in our group cared for it. I still sort of like the puzzle-y aspect, but (especially as a 5-6p game) there's too much luck for most people's taste in games in our group. Hard pass from the 6p perspective.

This one is not incredibly deep (and has lots of luck in card draws), but it has the simple elegance that I like in games. Easy to pull off the shelf and knock out the rules in a few minutes but meaty enough and with enough variety that you can see yourself playing again and again. The fact that it holds 6 players is a big bonus since we often seem to have 6p at our Friday game nights (and struggle to find good/satisfying 6p games)."
8,"Very nice, though very abstract.
Not at all for Maria.
Played it at 5 and it feels like a game that works best at higher player counts.
Not sure if I'd like this solo....."
7.5,"+ Compact game with so many agonizing decisions; Deciding how hard to push your luck and what combinations to work towards keeps you on your toes throughout.
- I wish there was a better storage/play solution for having all of the buildings in separate bags.


Why it's previously-owned:
This game ended up being okay. I got a bunch of plays in with it, and enjoyed each play just fine, but never felt like coming back to it. If I didn't have piles of outstanding games to keep me wanting to get back to them, I would keep this. But as it is, it wasn't going to get played much."
1,"Good ""roll and write"" game, except the ""roll"" is player deterministic. This makes the game better than many roll and writes.

Still an incredibly dull game. Too solitaire for my taste. The player elimination can be annoying if you got eliminated early and the game drags on for the others."

5,"You ever feel a sneeze coming on but your friend distracts you so you can’t actually get the sneeze out? That’s a good analogy for the feeling I get when I play this game.

I really thought this game would be exciting and fun while allowing players to make meaningful placement decisions. In reality, this game is pretty mediocre to me. At best it can be a semi-engaging past-time and at worst it can be one of the most frustrating gateways I’ve played to date.

Everyone sees the set of buildings available at the beginning of the game and you each try to figure out one or two combos that you’ll focus on. You eagerly start planning your town in your head. After all, you are the sole city planner. You envision the gorgeous look and feel your town will have by the end; you are the master of your destiny! Your town will have three cottages there, a farm in that corner, then a couple inns with some wells in between.

Your opponent calls out “let’s go with brick.” Damn that throws things off, I really need glass or stone right now. Not to worry, I’m sure one of those are bound to be called in next. “Wheat.” Hmm, ok that really sucks. “Let’s go with another brick.” It’s now back to your turn and you have 3 cubes that you had no intention of having in your town right now. So now what? You have to adjust your dream town to accommodate the whims of your opponents.

The game tempts you with fun combos and adorable possibilities, so naturally you plan it out in your head as you go. When it’s all set up, the game looks like it’s offering you the chance to construct your town however you want to. But within two rounds you realize any real strategic planning is futile. You just don’t have enough control in this game to make the decisions fun or worthwhile. The game inherently removes the incentive to plan anything because you can never know what resource will be called that you will be forced to use. Tiny Towns very quickly devolves into damage control: the game. By the end, your town looks nothing like how you wanted, you have useless resource cubes everywhere (which subtract points from your final score), and you’re left with a sour taste in your mouth.

This isn’t even a flaw in the game design. I think this is exactly what the game is supposed to be. It’s a low rules overhead intro game with great components and art. It just feels like such a bait and switch to me. Constructing your buildings, planning the combos, seeing your town come to life, that’s what I wanted. But what you get is a tactical, chaotic, frustrating game of bingo where your woodland architectural dreams are crushed.

Games like Patchwork or Calico are similar in that the skill comes from being flexible and having contingencies in place. But those two titles don’t tempt you to plan your quilts from the beginning of the game. No one starts Calico and says “ok I want the outer edge to be my polka dot greens and yellows, and then I want some floral pink scattered throughout.” There, the tactical choices evolve as the game goes on in a much more organic way. In Patchwork, you’re forced to think somewhat short term. Pick the piece you can afford and that fits your quilt right now. There’s no long term planning advertised in those games. But again, in Tiny Towns you're lured in with the theme and the belief that you’ll get to choose which buildings to combo together. Then the rug is quickly pulled from underneath you as you realize any sense of control or long term planning was a lie. You want to build that inn, or that farm, and you’re so close. But your friend keeps screwing with you and you can never get that sneeze out.

I don’t think I would seek out a chance to play this game. But I guess if someone really wanted to play it I would oblige without much fuss. It’s just not a game that gives me an experience that is enjoyable enough to chase after. If you’re on the fence about this game and you have any strategic bone in your body, steer clear at all costs."
8.8,"I really enjoy Tiny Towns as a 2 player game, using a house rule turn rotation (p1 chooses, p2 chooses, then draw a card).

The experience is quick and the more you play, the deeper the decisions seem to be."
6,"Decent little game, the turns go fairly quick. However, at certain points there is some AP because you are constantly trying to minimize your opponents scoring options and maximize yours. Overall, I thought this was ok, but I think playing solo was actually better. For whatever reason the constant tension of picking something good for me, but bad for you grew tired by the end of the game, nto to mention the constant bad resources your being given by your opponents. Not a bad game, and one I would play again if asked, but I am probably not seeking it out either."

8,"First demoed this at PAX Unplugged. Absolutely loved the quick playing puzzly nature of this one, and how it played up to six with very little down time."
7,"Simple, fast but difficult to mesh everything together. Definitely a challenging game for it's weight. Great filler."
8,2019-06: I am all about this game. The variable set up is awesome (and demands expansion). The puzzle is incredibly engaging and stress inducing as you do not have control over what the majority of your building materials are. Please give me more Tiny Towns.

5,"1 play:

I enjoyed playing Tiny Towns, but less than I expected. Much of the gameplay is basically on rails -- here and there I need to take a gamble on where to place a resource, but most of the time there's either a clear answer, or it's basically a crapshoot. There are opportunities for interaction, but they are limited, and the version where you decide which resource everyone takes requires some fairly tedious comparison of opponents' boards to the building recipes.

It's a neat game mechanic in theory, but in practice there just isn't much that's satisfying or surprising. You build a complex building or two, then build simpler ones. If it worked out well, some of your town's attributes multiply. If it didn't, well, it didn't. But since you're not building an actual engine, but only subtracting from buildable land, it's an exercise in steady constriction rather than steady empowerment.

8,It's a fun introductory game for the family. It almost feels like playing tetris on a board except more fun. It is not as interactive as other games but I wouldn't make this the highlight game. It would probably be the game you play a couple of rounds before the main game on a game night at least. If you like cute little animals and colorful pieces this is your game.
6,"SOLD

After a few plays it offers a nice puzzle and scales well using the town hall variant. Doesn't outstay its welcome. Cottages almost feel overpowered. I never figured out a way to get away from them but I also didn't play a whole lot. May have been the card combinations that made them such a powerhouse.

Ended up selling this because the people I would play with were divisive on it. Love it or hate it while I was warm to it. Kind of a shame because it scales. Definitely prefer this over Cartographers and so far this is the one roll n' write I might request on occasion but the box is so obnoxiously big for what it is and in the end it wasn't getting much attention in the neighborhood."
4,"I am not the biggest fan of ""take and make"" games where you build your own player area with largely incidental interaction with other players. As those games go, this is far from the worst example with some nice simple rules and components and a short play-time, but there's almost always something else I'd rather play."
4,"Quickly starts to feel like the same thing again and again, too random at higher player counts. Pass."
7.5,Fun and easy to teach. I've heard good things about the expansions as well.
7,"Original - 2019 05 06: Honestly, this is a great game. Almost every time I play Kingdomino, I wish for a quick town builder with more interesting decisions. This is the game I've been looking for.

Update - 2022 04 03: I forgot how clever it is. You really do have think about what you're doing not only now but what you're hoping to accomplish. You have to have multiple options going on while not accidentally blocking yourself in. The scoring system is interesting, the art is adorable, and the game is fun."
3,It's like someone's boiled down polyonimo games to their most annoying core and made a game out of that. Not for me.
8.7,"I was conflicted over selling this game, but I didn't love it solo and I think I played it out. An expansion probably would have breathed new life into it, but I didn't love it enough to do this."
6.5,"Cute game, simple mechanisms but not any different than any other spacial puzzle game. Despite BGG saying 6 people is not a good player count, given that it's simultaneous play don't see why it wouldn't work"
8.3,"Just when you think you've seen everything...

A spin through the rulebook suggests this is a fairly prosaic, family-friendly game. But it's much more than that: the spacial management is tough, and the interaction should - in the right hands - be downright mean. Feels very DXV-esque, in that the game procedurally generates a puzzle and the real challenge is trying to optimise that puzzle.

6.9,"Filler+ 2.1 - Too long for what it is. Not bad, though."
6,"This game hits a really nice sweet spot of being super quick to teach/learn, while also packing a good punch when it comes to decisions and how to play well.

If you like spatial puzzles, you'll love this game, as the entire game is about building buildings in ideal configurations in order to score the most points, but with the challenge of only getting to pick some of the resources you get to deal with, while having to accept the choices made by other players.

I can see this one becoming a pretty good hit for AEG since it really nails simplicity of rules while not skimping on game play."
4.5,"Will have to try again at 3-4 player counts. At 2 players I felt like there was no room to really diverge strategies.

The surprising challenge to the game that isn't noticable from the dead simple rules is how much you actually have to plan out your board placement so that you don't limit your own build options"
6,"Interesting spacial game, but quite challenge... not sure if it's my ideal type of game."
7,It's a fun game. But apparently I'm terrible with spatial puzzles.
7,"This game is often forgotten on my shelf but that's not because there's anything wrong with it. It plays well and is easily taught and multiple rounds can easily be done in under an hour which I appreciate. It's colourful, simple and fun as a great game to teach strategy."
5,"In Tiny Towns, your town is represented by a 4x4 grid on which you will place resource cubes in specific layouts to construct buildings. Each building scores victory points in a unique way. When no player can place any more resources or construct any buildings, the game ends. No doubt this is a fairly unique game in its game play, I think my major complaint is that it is, well, tiny. The 4x4 grid seems too small and causes the game to end too quickly. But I guess that's the point."
7.5,A quick game with a little strategy but the small board limits your choices and keeps it from being overly-thinky. I've only played it solo so far but I imagine my scores will go down playing multi-player. The wood components are really nice.
7,It's such a great game! I played it for the first time the other day and can't wait to play it again!
10,Abstract Strategy/City Building. Super-fun logic puzzle and placement game with some great variants to mitigate what little luck-factor exists. Scales great across player count too.
7.7,"Nice short and not heavy game. I think we might look at a more randomized start next time, possibly incorporating the town hall rules. With two players it works but kills a lot of the suspense.

(Edit, 02/2022) The more we've played this, the more I've liked it. I would definitely rate this as one of my newer favorites."
3,"#Comment: A lot of people will love this, but it unfortunately falls into a category of games that I dislike (Azul, Sagrada, etc.) for feeling too restrictive."
8.9,"Rated on one play, but it may go up because this is a very nice game."
6,Town Hall variant is clever. Calling resources is meh. No fun completely screwing others
5,"Very nice components, interesting design idea, but doesn't compare favorably against other tetris type games like Cartographers or Patchwork."
7,"It's a fun little puzzle game that anyone can play because the rules are super simple yet the depth is good. It can be a bit AP but mostly turns are quick. There is a bit of opportunity, especially in higher player count games, for aggressive play to really frustrate. This depends on the group but if players look to see what other players are doing and then intentionally stick them with the worst resources it can be painful. Also, the starting cards vary in ability and can leave to chance a pretty significant part of play. I do enjoy it but I've experienced some pretty frustrated players so it definitely won't work for all groups.
The Fortune expansion adds some great stuff to the base game and I'd pretty much never go back to playing just the base game."
6,"It's an ok game, but too simplistic for me and not enough interesting decisions to make."
6,"It's an abstract puzzle game that I like. It's interesting to see the different combination of building powers each game and trying to figure out the best plan from there. The wooden building pieces are great! My 8 yo daughter, who doesn't love games, likes to play it so that is a bonus."
7,Quick game of town building. Place resources in shapes to replace them with buildings. Your future self will curse the flippant choices you make. Can play up to any number by replacing a player board and cubes with a pencil and paper.
7.5,"Fun and frustrating little package. 5 and 7 year old play it, but not particularly well."
10,"The rules are simple. Your map is full of options at the start, but as you build your town your choices become increasingly difficult. In a 2 player game you better be careful not to fill up your board too early, or I will be able to call all my own resources! Plays quickly with plenty variety thanks to the extra building cards available in the Fortune expansion."
8,"This game is so easy to learn and teach all while being a real brain-burner! You really have to plan ahead to maximize space and make some difficult decisions that may or may not payoff. I think this game probably has high replay value, though I'll have to play more games to see if there are certain strategies that can be used too much. A nice playtime that doesn't overstay its welcome. [Sleeved w/ Fantasy Flight]"
7,"Good game. Cute little house pieces.

I like the organization of putting the pieces in tetris shapes. Even non-board game players can quickly pick it up and have fun."
7.5,Really solid game with nice variety in possible game combos (like Sushi Go! Party) but has a unique resource placement mechanic and building values like Between Two Cities. Was very good with 2 players and I think it would get even better but also more difficult with more. Look forward to a play with more people.
6.5,"Very tight, very puzzly, and potentially very mean. Definitely not a game for everyone, but I don't mind it as long as it's with the right group."
,"+ Villagers expansion, Fortune expansion, Tiny Trees and FLGS & Larkstone promos"
10,10 year olds favorite game and also a favorite of my 12 year old and myself. Will never turn down a game of this one.
6,"Borrowed this from the library. Only played two player one time. The game was quite frustrating, especially towards the end. I like games to get more fun as they progress, not the other way around. Love the artwork though."
8.5,"- Very good! Strong desire to play again!

Solid first impression. Tight building space but minimal interaction.

After more plays, the interaction really ramps up. It can get brutal when players begin to realize which resources to call for that help them and hurt their opponents. Very fun and challenging!"
7,"Easy rules, quick to learn. Extremely nice art and components. Playing feels great until your opponents keep choosing the ""wrong"" components. Evil opponents! Great variability in the different building cards. Quick play time, lots of fun.

7,"A puzzle deeper than it appears with huge replay ability. Scales flawlessly to 6 players, this is a keeper."
8,Quite thinky. Solo mode is okay. A great medium-light gateway game for people newly introduced to board games.
6,Didn't enjoy this game as much as I thought I would.
8,"A fun, little game that works with any group. I especially like how easy it is to teach and how the game immediately creates emotional tension for the whole table."
9,"Incredible resource organizing game. Similar to Triple Town on iPhone, but required to organize things in patterns as opposed to sets. Amazing fun."
6.5,"Satisfying, pleasant grid builder. Simple yet effective solo mode in the box."
8,"11/5/20 BEWARE: I just bought & opened my own copy &the painted wooden components STINK OVERWHELMINGLY of burned plastic &/or some kinda toxic chemical solvent & feel kinda oily. The smell stays on my fingers after i handle them &stinks up my house when the box is open. The smell has also completely permeated the ziplocs, cards & rulebook. I don't remember the copy that i played at gamenight having any such issue whatsoever, but i looked up ""smell"" on the BGG forum & quite a few other folks have this problem. None reported Alderac (AEG) offering a solution beyond suggesting that it might be counterfeit &, in 1 case, replacing it with a copy with the same stench! Hopefully they'll replace my copy or they are in for a BARRAGE of negative press from me. If they do replace it i'll report as much here in glowingly friendly terms &return my rating to a solid 8!
Too late! I returned it to the retailer. It's a pity... it seems like a really fun game & i love quite a few of Alderac's other games.

1/3/21 Found a used copy at local 2nd hand store. Same stench, almost as strong. Gonna try washing all the painted wood with strong lemon dish soap, spreading all the paper &cardboard around my storage unit to air out for a month or 2, &replacing all the ziplocks. I'll post results on the forum
-- Accessible yet challenging little puzzle. Played once about a year ago &quite enjoyed it. I forget the name of the purple building that lets you specify a particular resource on your turn whenever you want, not just for yourself, but for everybody, but it seemed a bit OP (overly powerful) with the Town Hall rules? Dunno for sure."
2,"Tiny Towns was a big letdown - but a premeditated letdown at that. I do not enjoy games with little to no interaction, and this is basically a roll & write except that the roll it's either a deck, or each player's choice.
These are not my type of games.
I'd actually be interested in learning the puzzle itself, how should I place things cleverly to not block myself etc.. but I think that I'm more likely to do that playing on a phone (if ever) than at a table with 4-5 other players.
Cute presentation, cute art, may be a good puzzle, may have interesting interactions with the buildings among themselves, but overall, it's not my type of game."
7.5,"10/19 B24 Clever little game about building buildings on your player mat. Gotta be careful and pay attention to where a building will actually sit after you build it. Fun game!
5/20 M24+Fortunes"
7,This is one that we just keep coming back to. A good game for a group of gamers at different skill levels. Good replay with the random set of building types. It would rate as an 8 except that a few of the buildings just don't seem to be worth the resources and effort to construct them.

5,"I don't really see the appeal of this one. It's OK, it works, maybe just too simple."
9,"I like this game, but as I have played more, I end up usually winning and destroying newcomers, and it makes it less fun. I like this best at 5 players, so I get less resources that I want. I am hoping to maybe grab an expansion for this game to add some shelflife to this, I do love the design and gameplay."
8.1,Very well done city builder. Like the variety this game has to offer with each play.
6.5,"Tiny Towns is pretty fun. It's easy to understand, but there are tons of interesting decisions packed into that little board. I'm looking forward to playing this one more."
9,This was even more fun than I expected. So satisfying to fill in the gaps and has a tetris feel
7,"Beautiful puzzle game. Lovely components. Great player interaction for a puzzle that could have very easily been made to feel like solitaire. At high player counts, be prepared to get stuck, but in a fun way? I never thought I'd be so mad to hear ""wheat!"""

7,"I think this game is an epic game for lots of players! If you like Tetris type games, then this game is for you!"
7.5,"Tiny Towns is a fine family weight game that gamers will enjoy. When a player is the master builder, they name a resource that everyone must use in their city. You are placing these resources on a 16x16 grid in order to build buildings in your village. So, part of the game is trying to figure out what others are building and then leverage what they are collecting to build your own town. The different buildings interact with each other differently, so plan wisely. The game becomes too chaotic with more players: best at 3 or 4."
7,Very solid game. Easy to learn but there is a fair bit of strategy and the different buildings make it a good one to replay. Good for new board game players.
6,"I'm eh about this, but my husband and gaming group love it. I don't like having to do what others force me to do."
8.6,"Tiny Towns is a hit. Players enjoy it. It is filled with dilemmas and choices. Not much player interaction, though."
6,I got to play my friend's copy of the game. The game gets tight really quick. You gotta pay attention to what people are doing or else you will end up with negative points like my parents! I can see with more players the game gets tighter faster because there is less control on the color cubes you are going to get.
6.5,"Was fun the first few times, but as you try to do better, it gets quite stressful."
10,"Amazing. Casual game, Mix of tetris and yatzee. But nor really. But truly easy for new players, doesn't last too long. And fun. Great strategy and interaction and replayability!"
,"6 player simple personal town building, turns taken simultaneously. Published: 2019"
6,"A spatial puzzle I seem to get worse and worse at every time I play! But it's cute. I think I prefer the ""players pick"" to the mostly random option of the cards, but I'm not sure."
8,"This is a very fun game, especially for people who like puzzles. The spacial puzzle at the core of this game is challenging and entertaining. You really have to try and anticipate what the players around you are trying to build so you can plan for what resources they will call. We always play with the Cavern rule, that's my advice to any new players. It hasn't gotten old, but the expansion would be fun to have and try!"
3,"I literally scored 1 point. That may sound bitter, but it’s just a random fest of cube drawing/placement. Pass on it!"
6,"Not for me. Seems way too constrained and limiting. I was really looking forward to this one, as I love the idea of this type of game. Go away, hype beast! Still searching."
5,A bit dry and boring. Placing cubes and buildings just isn't very enjoyable. The components are nice.
6,"This game feels very tight! It starts pleasant enough and then really gets negative quick. I thought certain pink tower powers will determine who wins and loses the game. You can plan ahead so much and then you may be at the will of a draw of someone who is hate drafting to destroy your buildings. That's part of the game, but made me feel like I wasn't in complete control. You can anticipate what others will do and prepare for them. There is also wisdom in knowing when to complete a certain building to open up space for others. Overall thought it was fun to lear and try out, but a bit too punishing and tight for how light the theme feels. Hate drafting is alive and well and so, so mean! Components and cards were nice and colorful."
7,"Positives: Love that the game is variable every time. Love the quick play. Love how frustratingly good the strategy of where to place your resources is. I really enjoy city building games like this where you get stuff for adjacent stuff or stuff that meets a certain criteria.

Negatives: Still a light game (which isn't always my favorite). Can also be very mean or random depending on which variant you use.

Overall: Great little light game. I think I still like Reef more. Really can't wait to show this one to my wife. I see what the hype is about and I think this is the type of game that will get a lot of play with the family over the years."
8.5,"Excellent spatial puzzle. Simultaneous turns means it plays pretty fast. Freeing up a cluttered board by placing buildings exactly where you need them is very satisfying. Haven't played enough to have any real comments on replayability, but there's many different building cards and you'll have a unique configuration each game so I think it'll last a while before I need to consider grabbing the expansions."
7,"Easy to learn. Takes 5 minutes to explain. After 1 or 2 turns everyone understands how to play. I have played it at 3, 5, and 6 and it plays well at all of those player counts. It is really an abstract/puzzle game. Not sure why it is not rated as and abstract game. I am sure it would rank high. Games are pretty quick. It can become difficult at the end of the game to figure out where to put building materials, which is part of the challenge. Overall a good game that I believe most people would like to play."
5.9,"P: 1-6 T: 30-60 min

Seems to have all of the elements of a SdJ nominee. Spatial grid city placement, bingo style resource, city builder with variable setup. Certainly see the comparison to Azul, Reef, Sagrada; this may be the best of that bunch. Spatial planning reminds me a bit of Triple Town app game (which my wife LOVES)

After many plays this game is starting to fade for us. While the components are solid and the art is pleasant, the theme is pretty much pasted on. With two players, it usually digresses into who can figure out how to clog up the other player so they can make as many remaining buildings as possible, which isn't that enjoyable for us. At higher player counts, strategy disappears as you make the best of what you're dealt. Has tended to leave people in our extended family a bit frustrated and asking for different games."
7,"Love this game, but the replayability is not as high as some others, could use more cards, or added mechanisms to add some longer-term interest.

6,"Here's the thing. Although this SHOULD be easy and breezy as its a bingo selection placement game - it just isn't that easy. Because the patterns to score are hard to do and consider and get frustrating. And the interaction of things is just a little too much for fun-loving family fair. At least for me.

7,"Quick to teach and fairly easy to learn, Tiny Towns offers a lot of variety in the different building setups. Definitely has an appeal for those that enjoy spatial puzzles, and it’s pretty awesome to see your town slowly coming alive. We played with the normal rules where each person get to call the resource, which can be cutthroat if you’re not careful. Will have to see if the town hall method offers a different take on the overall gameplay."
8,"I really struggle with spatial games like Tiny Towns, but that doesn't prevent me from appreciating what a great game it is. The rules are fairly simple; collect materials in your town, use materials to build buildings, and get building benefits.

The balance of fitting in the materials with building the correct buildings with preventing your opponents from completing their town makes for a deeper game than the first impression gives you. The game never feels unfair and the huge variety of set ups makes it always feel fresh."
8,"Tiny Towns contains all the joy and puzzley fun of ""Tetris"" with a relaxing art direction reminiscent of Everdell. This is a simple game that requires a combination of visualization and advanced planning. Those who enjoy spacial problems and thinking several moves ahead to achieve the perfect city layout are in for a treat."

7,"19B
Very quick puzzle like game. Good as filler. More fun at higher player counts (seems kind of unbalanced at 2)."
7,Nice non-confrontational game where everyone seems to enjoy it. As a filler it takes just a little too long to play. As a short game it's a little weak on complexity.
7,"A fine little puzzly game that feels similar in weight to lighter games like Kingdomino, yet manages to offer an almost overwhelming number of possibilities to players in a small space. If you want to, you can spend a lot of time thinking about where you are going to place a cube! The final few turns can be painful as you never quite get the cubes you need. Generally though, it moves along quite quickly and shouldn't take more than an hour to play.

Artwork is nice, colourful, and clean, and there are lovely bits for the completed buildings."

6.8,Did not like the abstract game. Really nice theme that never shines through with actual gameplay.
5,"I bought this game because I have heard many good things about the solo play. I tried the solo play more than 5 times, and I didn't like it. Using the deck to determine resources made me kind of crazy - I could see how some people would enjoy it and be very strategic about it though. I've played it with my partner a couple of times (2p) and he straight up doesn't like it, and I'm not a big fan either. It is a beautiful game though. I absolutely LOVE all the adorable wooden buildings. The artwork is so cute. I rated it 5/10 because that's how I feel about it, but the quality of the game is 10/10 and the gameplay is good, it's just not for me."
6,"A delightful and meditative town builder with Tetris elements the puzzles the brain and is a lot more ruthless than it feels, which allows lots of people to play."
7,"On the first play, I enjoyed Tiny Towns moderately. I was playing with three who had played many times, and it looked to me like they had established a very planned approach to building their town, and I wonder if the game becomes very scripted for people the more they play? Second play was a two player game and we both made several placement mistakes throughout the game."
9,"Only solo plays for now, but the quick puzzle is a really nice break. I really need to pick up a good insert to make setup faster as it seems to take as long to get ready as to play."
7,"Popular with the ladies and the babies. Fun with kids much younger than the recommended age, but still rewards some mindful polyomino-type resource placement. Short, but doesn't leaving me wishing it went on longer. The variant rules are more chaotic.
(Traded for The Quest For El Dorado)"
6,Good game but the number of factors to account for when deciding placement makes it too much a brain burner for a short game.
8,Excellent light game. Fun pieces. Easy to learn. Good choice for a casual game with people who aren't intense gamers or who just want to relax and have a social game.
7,"A fun, tetris-y type of game that has a bit of randomness based on which resources appear when (often not when you want them), but presents an interesting puzzle in figuring out how to maximize points based on where each building is constructed in your Tiny Town."
6,"Similar feel to Quadropolis and a little Kingdomino. Good gateway game. Simple, intuitive rules"
9.5,"I did an online play through using just a piece of paper with a grid & some cubes and really, really enjoyed it! So I bought the game.

I had wanted to try it out for a while, but was not sure how it would feel to have the ""wrong"" resource get chosen, but really the fun was absolutely in making the ones you got work for you, and pivoting as things changed"
7.1,"Simple game, easy to teach but plenty of decision making room to make for a fun game. I'd have no issues suggesting someone add this game to their collection and often find myself suggesting this game with new gamers or more experienced gamers that want a quick enjoyable experience."
8,"A lovely little game! Easy to learn, tough to master. It also has great graphic design and art and has high replay value due to the variety of cards and their interactions. The main negative is the stupidly large box and insert; this box could probably be half the size. Overall, a definite keeper in my collection."
8,Played solo. A fun little experience! I love a good simple spatial puzzle and this provides in spades!
7,"Delightful and original game. The rules are relatively easy but the gameplay offers some very think puzzles as you figure out where to put the next block or building. It plays quickly with lots of variety in the various cards. Can be played pretty cutthroat, but either way, a lot of fun."
9,"Easy to learn, with an “easy” mode to start or to teach others, but hard to master, with many changing strategies. This game is wonderful!"
7,"I've realized that this is what I want most roll-and-write's to be. Of course, this ISN'T a roll-and-write (no rolling or writing), but managing/anticipating (and mitigating) elements otherwise out of your control is interesting. It's just more interesting when you have information to go on and when you can make educated guesses as to the coming tide. For such a super simple and super quick game, there are always plans to be made, layers to consider and incentives to balance. I might very well be deceived into thinking this is deeper than it actually is, but I'm ready to explore further. It works with gamers and with the family. And it's easy enough to teach to grandma. High utility here."

7.5,Good spatial puzzle with a nice variety to the game with the random draw of a card (from a set of 4) for each building.
7,Game group doesn't like this and the 1st expansion is weak.
,"good buzz. Rahdo likes alot & proffers Azul killer. On light side like Azul, so maybe skip? Jamey frustrated with shape mechanic.
Bought $22"
7,Needs more variety but the expansions are just so expensive for what they add.
6,"I want this to be better at the 2p count, but I don't think wishing will make it true. Kingdomino 7x7 is probably the better choice for that. However, this is a fun spatial solo puzzle and also a nice family-weight 3 or 4p game. Offers a similar ""what am I going to do with this piece?"" problem that Azul does, but is missing the tile selection elegance of Azul.

I really like what Tiny Towns is trying to do, but the random building draw can often feel unbalanced the way a Dominion random card draw does where you don't even bother with certain buildings."
8,Fun abstract game that I played at Gencon. I would really like to play this again.
7,"Have only played it once. Seems like a neat puzzle game. There looks to be a variety of possible scoring criteria, which should result in good replayability."
,"Nope, not for us. The central cards have a sort-of dominion feel: see what's there and figure out your combos? But then the spatial game fell flat... MUCH rather play patchwork (or Second Chance... or.... or). And the rhythm of calling resources? Bit dull."
9,"Quick and easy to teach. There's some competitiveness in trying to figure out which resources the other players will call, which make the game more than just a collaborate puzzle. One of my few complaints is that the special buildings aren't very balanced."
7,"A great abstract for families. This game can be as nice or mean as you'd like. Calling the resources can be simply saying the one you need or one can eye what others aren't needing and call that if it still benefits you. Really nice decisions and variability.

Initial Score: 8"
6.5,Crunchy and somewhat chess-like despite having separate boards. I’m interested to see how this plays with 3+ players.
8,Really engaging and thinky. love the components and the variants with rules. Can be interactive or multiplayer solitaire (which I like).
6,"Fun enough cube selection point salad affair with a town theme veneer. The point scoring is finnicky to me, but i'll play."
7.5,Really good. Every turn is a fun little puzzle to solve. Also a very VERY good game for non gamers. Anyone can pick this up and enjoy it.
6,"TRADED AWAY - I liked the tetris aspect. played it solo a few times, and it didn't have the longevity. Group wasn't wowed or thought ""fun"" while playing. I'd pick It's a wonderful world over this for something equivalent"
5,"Played back in 2019. The more I thought about it, the less I like it. I'll play it but you will never see me ask for it."
6,"interesting puzzle that gets restrictive real quick. works well for 6-players, but i can see how 2-players might turn into a chess match slog (or else a knife fight in a phonebooth, whichever better fits the couple). happy to play occasionally, but maybe not twice in a row. not purchased.

how much do i wish a replay? (condensed)...
10. - 9.6 = sunlight!! my identity as a gamer
9.5 - 8.6 = hot! hope to explore depth of!
8.5 - 7.6 = bright. actively seeking replay
7.5 - 6.6 = dimming. passively welcome plays
6.5 - 4.6 = done. play if good company requests
4.5 - 1.0 = reluctance > filibuster > evacuation"
6,"Initial reaction was that this game was terrible. The rules for a normal game tend to really reduce how much individuality goes into a town, since players take turns naming a communal resource that everyone gets one piece of and places. Most people get into the same mindspace and just go for the same buildings at the same time (what's that? you got stone? my turn to choose, guess I'll pick wood so I can build a fountain. turns out everyone else just builds the same fountain at that point too) so towns end up really samey and scores end up just being who built in a slightly better position than the other. Not to mention, the cards recommended for a first playthrough are incredibly bland, especially when all used at the same time. However, we decided to give it another shot and played using the Town Hall rules which introduced a random deck to decide which resource players get for 2 rounds, then each player independently chooses a resource for every third round. This spiced up the game so much, it got to the point where I pulled it out of the ""to sell"" box, and it took the game from something that was a boring snoozefest to something that I was actually proud to own. These rules, on top of some new, more exciting building cards, felt like a much better first impression I would want to give someone when playing this game. This makes me question why on earth the other way of playing is considered the standard rules? And why restrict the game so much by giving such bland cards for the first playthrough? Regardless, glad I decided to keep it, but it loses a point for the inevitable terrible first impression if one plays according to the first half of the rulebook."
7,Completely different experience between player counts. 2-3 is far more strategic while 4+ tends to be more tactical. The game provides a system to mitigate this effect at higher player counts and it works well.
6,"It’s ok. The Tetris-like board placement is fine, but also quite random and not that interesting. I would play this with someone who really wanted to play it, but I wouldn't seek it out."
8,"Probably will be better with more players, but still good game for two. Nice puzzle challenge."
7,"This is a good game (for a few plays), it gives a strong feeling of Tetris-like placement with resources that are converted into buildings. However, the game can be very thinky. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that those that over-analyze the game will take very long turns and certain long-play strategies appear to be rewarded too much in my opinion.

Over my last few plays, certain strategies have also emerged that make playing the game for new players difficult while veteran players will have a strong advantage.

It also seems silly you could quite possibly copy every move another player makes.

For me these things all lower this game quite a bit, from my original rating of 9 to 7."
8,"Fun puzzle, relatively easy to teach. Needs more plays to give honest review."
3,"My wife and I didn't find this interesting at all.
We played it a few times and didn't enjoy it all.
The concept and small board was a disappointment.
Will be selling it...."
7.5,Fun quick resource placement game. Fast play coupled with some thoughtful decisions which I absolutely love. Setup was almost as long as the first game (slightly jest...) so would highly suggest bagging components.
6,"Teaching time: 5 minutes
Playing time: 20-30 minutes

Loveable, accessible, and yet retains plenty of sharp edges if you play calling every resource. The builder deck converts it to a true roll-and-write puzzle with no interaction, and facilitates fun solitaire play. I wish the box were half the size for this style of game, though.

7.5,"Careful decision making on a tight grid. How do you start constructing? How do you set yourself up for future buildings? What do you want to focus on building and scoring? Grueling decisions, satisfying payoff, and a quick playtime all add to this one's cutesy charm."
8,"Delightful! Love the interaction for what is essentially a solo puzzle and the tension of trying to fit everything you want to do on that tiny board. Expansions really make this one shine.

Ducal Scale: 5/6"
9,We love the strategic aspect of this game! It really makes you think several turns ahead!
7,Light game of resource placement. The difficulty is in building patterns from other players picks which take up more room than when you cash the resources into the actual building. You might need 5 spaces for a building and then it condenses down to 1 when you build it. You'll often run into a jam and have to pivot your plans. It's super light but light enjoy to enjoy as a gateway game. Each building has specific scoring requirements and you'll often find yourself not being able to place them to score or kicking yourself in a corner. It's enough puzzle for about 30m with two players. The resource deck makes it so no players get to pick if you want more randomness. I am not sure about the long term replay ability outside of casual type of game during the weekday for us.
9,"Another Our Family Plays Games recommend. A good two player game, we had a good time with it and it is not difficult to learn. I hear mixed reviews of this one. I think if you like polynomial games you will like this one."
8,Wonderful family game with a fair amount of strategy to keep everyone in the action.
8,Great family weight game that is surprisingly difficult at times to do well at.
8,"A very good short game that my entire family enjoys playing. The geometric placement of resources and decision making for placing buildings is excellent educationally for children. The art and graphic layout is superb and really add to the game. The downside is that some of the more complex buildings are not worth enough to build instead of the smaller ones. But currently, this game is being played a lot!"
8.5,"Solid game. It's a much tougher game than the cute exterior would suggest, however. Not recommended for younger children."

7,Got this game on Mike's recommendation. Great game. Feels a bit like Cartographers and this other game that I can't remember.
7.5,"Nice, puzzley game. After looking into the expansions, I don't think the game needs the added rules to be a winner. In fact I think the added rules take away from the strategy of the game.

The new cards in the expansions are the only thing I'd be interested in."
6.5,"A bit of a disappointment. My rating is somewhat coloured by my partner's experience of the game, since she has not at all enjoyed her plays of the game. This seemed an obvious choice given our love for similar weight titles with similar mechanics - Reef, Scarabya, Kingdomino, and the like - but the spacial puzzle element is too pure. Navigating around each other's choice of resources doesn't feel like a small detour in plans but rather like running straight into a barricade. The puzzle is neither interesting enough to warrant keeping around for solo play."
7.5,"A fun puzzle game. Reminds me of Sagrada, as your limited in a small grid to accomplish certain goals which are randomized each game.

I prefer to play solo, or up to 3 max.

I highly recommend adding the $$/coins varient added in the expansion (easy to implement without owning the expansion). Basically, if you build 2 buildings at the same time, you take a coin. Coins can be spent to change a resource to any type, or saved for VP end-game. This fixed a lot of the issues I had with how limiting the base game is, while also adding some complexity, building 2 buildings at once as many times as possible."
7.5,Another one enjoyed by my wife. She loves the puzzly stuff.
8,"This is a fun, quick game where there is plenty of player interaction. You'll take turns calling out resources and placing them in the right shape on their town boards til they've completed whichever building they were making. It can be challenging to deal with all the resources other people are calling out that you don't want while still trying to plan ahead your overall city layout. Chaos can definitely thrive at times, but I have really enjoyed this game at all player counts."
8,We play it two-player most often; can get a little hectic/random with more players
6.5,"Theme: Town building
Gameplay: Drafting different colored blocks to construct patterns in your town to maximize scoring
Components: Colorful, simple, good.
Replayability: Light but very satisfying

4,"I purchased this game to be a potential solo game as well as a fun game for two or three to play. We played it three times before we realized the game is extremely repetitive. The majority of the time, the player that won would build cottages, their monument, whatever the red building was, and a few of the gray small buildings. The only time this player didn't win was when the green building offered 20+ points, then they would win by playing those. I wanted to like this game because it looks very nice and can be an interesting puzzle, but after playing it a few times my friends and I were bored. I returned it to Amazon. Additionally, it did not have the complexity I was looking for, and I would fly through solo and two-player games. Highly overrated game IMO."
6,"Interesting game trying to complete small patterns on your board to collect buildings for points. The mechanic where you have to take the same cube as each player on their turn makes it tricky and difficult. Planning what you want to do can be sidetracked fairly easily by what other players select and the board is so small it feels very restrictive. There are lots of personal goal cards and different building cards to add replayability to the game. Decent game but no desire to own it,"
