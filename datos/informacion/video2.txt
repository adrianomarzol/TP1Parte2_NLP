[Music] and now it's time for another dice tower review with tom vassell [Music] hi folks i'm tom vassell today we're taking a look at tiny towns aeg has really progressed as a company it's really interesting to see where their games have gone last year they released a game called space space which was really easy for everyone to play rolling dicing and collecting resources a very simple game that is was one of my most played if not the most played game of the year so i was very interested that they have another game kind of in the same line uh peter mcpherson has made a game here called tiny towns which when someone asks me they're like how do you describe tiny towns i'm like ah it's bingo-esque which is kind of i think the best way to describe it because someone's gonna be calling out a resource everyone's placing that resource on your board and trying to match patterns now there are a lot of pattern matching games that are out there but usually they involve one big board that everyone's working on you're trying to build patterns in it in this one you each have your own player board whatever here's how it plays [Music] at the beginning of each game you're going to go through decks of cards and draw one of each of these cards and place it face up in the middle of the table you can also pick a set there's a starting set that they mentioned each player is also going to get two of these purple tower cards you don't have to just play in a beginner game but you probably should and then you take one of them and put this in your hand each player is also going to get one of these and i should mention that there's a cottage card out here but this card is in every game so these are the different buildings there are seven different buildings that can be built over the course of the game eight if you include the tower and then there is a whole pile of resources here each of those resources stands for a typical resource that you might have stone brick wood glass wheat etc one player goes first that player is given a start marker and they're going to pick a resource so maybe in this case they pick grain although you're eventually just going to say yellow so they say yellow and everybody is going to place a yellow on their board you can place it anywhere you want on your board but you must place it on your board then someone else might say blue uh and then someone else might say red and look lo and behold no i built that the wrong way so hopefully i would have put the yellow there in the blue there in which case i match this card now if you match a card that's on the table you take those cubes off and where one of those cubes was you'll place a building of that type so here i put a cottage down now when you put a building down you can no longer put cubes in that spot you also don't have to do it so maybe i have for example two reds and a blue here but that's not what i'm trying to build i want to build this one here so i'm trying to get two grays another red and a brown and now i can build to my factory here and so players are going to be all building different things you're probably not going to be building the same buildings as everybody else after a while and also each player is going to call it whatever resource they want as an alternative you can also take this deck of cards here and draw cards from this deck and everyone puts that out for the two and then you can put out a resource of your choice then you draw two more and then you put out a resource of your choice so that's an alternate way to do it if at any point you have cubes out for your tower which is secret you're like hey i built my tower you take the cubes off and you put your tower on the board sometimes when you build a tower it will give you something that you can do right away but like this one here for example says immediately place a building on any empty square in your town but usually they're just going to be worth points at the end of the game see that's why you're placing everything here is for points and every point everything's going to be different cottages are always the same there are three points if they're fed these buildings the farm buildings essentially are going to feed the cottages in different ways for example this one here feeds all the buildings in the eight squares that surround that farm while this one here feeds any four buildings in town this one here feeds all buildings in the same row and columns so they're going to be different wells are going to get points for being adjacent to stuff so this millstone here gets two points if it's adjacent to a farm or a yellow building the church type buildings usually give you points for where they are this one gives you one point for each church it's in a corner of your town markets this one here gives you a point for each market in the same row or column this cottage here we already mentioned the cottages taverns you get points based on how many taverns you built so if i build five taverns i'm gonna get 20 points and factories also let you get out of a special ability this says when you have a factory place a resource on it you'll notice that the factories have spots to put resources on them and then whenever someone says that resource i can pick a different resource instead and there's you know the towers do all sorts of things i can place all future buildings on any empty square in my town replace two buildings with any other building this gets two points for each unique adjacent building type so there's all sorts of towers one point for each adjacent cottage two points if it's next to another well here i can treat these as wild resource for future buildings uh there's one point plus one for each of these tailors that's in the four center squares in your town so all sorts of things so players are going to keep going now eventually since you have to put a cube out there will come a point where you put a cube out and you can't replace it with a building or you replace the final square in your thing with a building no it's not possible you're just gonna have to fill it up and maybe you can't build any more buildings in which case you're done and then the turns keep going until everyone is finished once everyone is finished you're going to score each type of building until you get a final score so in this particular game the factories didn't have any scores and you can see the cottages and all the different things that scored and at the end of the game whoever has the most points is the winner and sometimes scores can be very wild like in this game this loser named tom only scored three points because you do lose a point for each space on the board that you uh that you only have a cuban and don't have a building in and this person did not get enough points through other methodologies that's pretty much it that's how you play tiny towns lots of wooden pieces in this game and i like to point out that these plastic containers don't come in the game i just added them myself just for ease i mean the resources are just cubes and this hammer is neat but we gave up passing this around the table first player kind of kind of fiddly but i like the buildings they're all different colors but they're also very different shapes so they're very easy to tell apart they look really good on the table and while these boards are you know fairly boring 4x4 boards once they have the buildings on they look pretty good i really enjoy that the cards are nice and huge they're good quality cards uh they have nice pictures on them and they're very easy to see exactly what colors are needed to uh you know build the grid whatever they're gonna be and they're different for each one so you never know what color might be useful in a town or not and then the score pad is nice and big and colorful and i'm probably going to laminate mine because i think we'll run out of them fairly quickly but overall great components [Music] now here's the interesting dichotomy of tiny towns that i find fascinating one is that the game is extremely easy i tell everyone how to play i can teach this game in just a few minutes here grab the resource put the resource on your board you get the resources down you take them off put the building on super easy everyone can play it secondly it's really hard now i know it sounds odd but it's the truth it's easy to play and easy to jump into you can really mess yourself up in this game by you're like okay i got these resources here's a building put this building here oh because i put that building there now i can't build stuff there oh no in fact there's a rule in this game called the cave where essentially you can take two cubes that are called out and place them next to your board you have to put them on right away for beginners and i'm telling you i feel like i'm pretty good at spatial games sometimes and this game kicked my butt at least the first couple times because uh just how that worked out but i like the game i keep coming back to it and every not everyone but almost everyone i played it with uh enjoyed it also the games is 45 minutes on here it's probably most of the time gonna be faster than that 30 minutes but it's this game where everyone's involved all the time you got red everyone's like red everyone puts on your board everyone's done okay next green and then someone's like or gray someone's like why did you place gray we don't need another gray well i need a degree now i will say that it is immensely more difficult to play this game with more players because you have less control of calling out the colors and in fact i would highly suggest that if you're playing with five or six players to use the deck of cards because every third cube you at least get to pick the color that's going out and so that gives a little bit more control i feel with more players because if we were playing with six players for example and it goes around the table you're going to be five colors you don't get to pick while in a four player game you have more control that three point score was a six player game for that loser player named tom this is a game that i feel is going to be a big hit i feel like a lot of people are going to be playing this at conventions because it's so easy you call it out it's going to appeal to the people who like roll and write games it's going to appeal to people who like bingo s games like rise of augustus and things like that and it but it's also puzzly for people who like heavier games you can sit there and really kind of think this out now it's not very long and drawn out you put a cube there but you got to sit there and go okay i can't build all the buildings you just can't so what buildings am i going to do these buildings you have different points in fact one of the buildings i enjoyed if you build an odd number you got negative points if you build an even number you got positive points so you're trying to build up to get that huge positive point number but not have an odd number before the game ends and if you only concentrate on that builder you're giving up points for other things the towers help a little bit because everyone has a chance to build a tower that no one else has and it gives you like a little bit of uniqueness against everyone else uh and that also helps because i know someone will sit there and go why can't you just copy your neighbor well if you have the towers in play you really can't because their tower is going to be different than yours but even without towers when i played without towers people just all did different things some people said oh wells are easy i can build a bunch of those but they don't work really well unless i built other buildings so it's a neat concept it's expandable they could easily add more cards to it but as it is there's a lot of replayability you're gonna have a different set of cards every time and different players trying different things this is going to be a cool gateway game that's going to be played by a lot of people this year i i enjoy it and i think a lot of people are going to agree with me on tiny towns dice tower judgment excellent [Music] [Music] you
