Original post: Even though long extensive reviews seem to be the most popular reviews on BGG, I myself just don't have the time or the patience to read those.I prefer quick overviews where I can get some insights into why this game may or may not be attractive to me.My reviews are targeted at a similar audience, and just consist of my pros and cons coming from:1) First impressions (before playing my first game)2) Impressions after the first game3) Current feelings (after at least 10 plays)First impressions:+ There was quite a lot of hype around this game when it was released, which drew my attention (the BGG crowd doesn’t often overhype a game that I end up hating)+ I like the box art and the components very much+ This is a bingo-style game, in which everybody places a cube of the same colour each turn, but make their own choices on the patterns in which they are placed, which are used to place buildings on the 4x4 grid. I was hoping that by combing two copies of the game, I could support player counts of up to 12 players. (I’m always on the lookout for “non-party games” that support 10+ players) Impressions after the first game:+ This is easy to teach, and works well for both casual and more hardcore gamers+ Creating optimal patterns to get a high score and leave few spots empty (especially later in the game) makes for an interesting puzzle+/- I did enjoy this, but it was more abstract than I had hoped; the rules for the way in which each building generates points make little thematic sense (eg Cloisters score more points if they are built at the corner of your grid)+ Each building colour (except for the Cottages and the secret Monuments) comes with four different cards that provide a different way of scoring them. Each game only one of the four cards is used for each building, which adds a lot of variety (but AP-prone players may take a lot of time at the start of each game to determine their game plan)Current feelings (10 plays into it):- You can run into quite a bit of down time if you finish early, as the other players keep playing until they have filled their grids completely. (Depending on how fast they play) This killed my idea for trying to combine two copies for a large player count.+/- Everybody gets one building that only they can build - these add more variety, but throw of the balanced a little imho; some powers these buildings generate (like being allowed to place future buildings anywhere you want) are considerably stronger than others.+ There are two ways to play; either flip cards that show which colour cube gets placed, or have players take turns deciding on the colour – they both work well and each tailors to people with a different taste (the first being multiplayer solitaire, the second with more – often negative – player interaction). Also,  the first option works better with higher player counts, to avoid somebody getting a lot of cubes he/she can’t use.- Getting the right cube at the right time, especially towards the end of the game, can have a huge impact on your score, which is why I dislike playing with the cards that determine which resource gets placed (as that makes it more a game of luck), and also makes me not a big fan of the solo variant (which uses the cards)End conclusion (well, for now):This is a good game, and I appreciate it for what it is, but it lacks something that makes me really want to play it often. The art and components sell this game, but at the heart it is an abstract strategy game. I like it once I start playing it, but I rarely feel like bringing it out. My wife‘s dislike for spatial puzzles doesn’t help either (although she likes this more than others). Will probably trade this away.

Original post: Tiny Towns is by Peter McPherson for one to six players and is an abstract pattern building game. It comes in a Ticket To Ride sized box with a great plastic insert.
Response number 1:
The components are really high quality. It has 126 wooden buildings in seven different shapes and sizes. It also comes with 90 wooden resource cubes in five colours representing different building resources. There is also a really cool master builder wooden hammer. It certainly has table presence and reminds me a bit of Medina.Each player has a player board with sixteen spaces that they can build buildings. Buildings require different resources which have to be set out in a proscribed pattern.  There is a fair amount of variability in set up with one card chosen from four available cards of each building type. Cottages are always available to be built.
Response number 2:
Each player also chooses one of two randomly selected monument cards. This gives you a unique building you can build in your village which allowed you to score bonus points. Each player can only build one monument building. There are 15 monument cards to select from.
Response number 3:
Gameplay is really simple. Each turn the master builder calls out one of the five colours and each player places a cube of this colour on their board. There is no complicated adjacency rules and the cube can be placed on any empty space on the board. Next, if any player has the right combination of cubes (resources) to build a building they can place it. The new building must be placed where one of the resource cubes were. The master builder then rotates to the next player. It quickly becomes obvious that you need to think carefully where you place your buildings and cubes. It is easy to create spaces that are impossible to build on. There are not single resource buildings and only one two resource building. Empty spaces result in a point being deducted (unless you have the monument card that prevents this) so careful planning is required. Sometimes you need to build a building knowing it won’t score but you build it anyway to avoid the penalty for an empty space.
Response number 4:
Most of the buildings have bonuses for with being adjacent to other buildings, for number of cottages, being in corners or not being adjacent to other buildings. It quickly becomes a complex logic puzzle. Sometimes the combination of building cards randomly selected will result in buildings not being complimentary or indeed having conflicting requirements. Once a player can no longer place a building then he passes and the game ends when all players have passed. The games scales well. Solo play is very satisfying with a deck of cards, showing the coloured cubes (resources) to imitate a multiplayer experience. Some specific building cards are removed for solo play. Game play is quick so six players can play without the game getting bogged down. Our games have taken about half an hour to 45 minutes.The game comes with a handy colour coded score pad. Scoring is simple and scores can be negative. Cottages usually only score if they are fed. Cottages can be fed by building farms, granaries, greenhouses or orchards. Sheds are particularly useful ad they don’t have to be built where the resource cubes were. Some of the buildings have a maximum that can be built. The most complex buildings are the industrial type buildings. Some of these can store resources that give you added flexibility.
Response number 5:
There is a variant suggested in the rules, the cavern rule, which allows you to keep up to two resources to the side. There is also the ability to play with the solo play random cards called the “town hall” rules. This would speed up play at larger player counts.This game is the latest in a long line of abstract puzzle comes including Azul, Santorini, Cottage Garden and Barenpark. They are quick, lite and fun games. This scales well and has a great solo option. The artwork it lovely if not spectacular. It is a simple game to play, with out any complex rules. However, there is a fair amount of strategy and forward planning required to score well. It is very easy to block yourself in. I think it has quite a lot of replayability and I like the fact it plays up to six. I can see it becoming a favourite in board game clubs. I also think that it represents good value for money given the quality and quantity of wooden buildings. There is nothing really new here, but it’s a elegant design that has been well executed.

Original post: Teensy TownsI’m not sure there’s a title that makes my eyelids droop more than Tiny Towns. The back of the box only deepens my fatigue. Colorful cubes, check. Little woodcut buildings, cute. A blank 4×4 grid for each player, groan. Pastoral scenes of golden farms and thatched granaries and unkempt almshouses — credit where it’s due, there’s a cure for insomnia here.But as Socrates said, “Don’t judge a scroll by the gross animal veins in its parchment.” So too it is with Tiny Towns. Although this isn’t the sort of game that gets my heart pounding, it’s no soporific.
Response number 1:
There are three broad ways to play Tiny Towns, but the gist is the same in each. You want to build (tiny) buildings on your (tiny) town plot, so you place (tiny) resources into those (tiny) squares, and hope you’ve shown enough foresight to leave (tiny) openings where you can slot new buildings or resources in the future.And it’s both incredibly simple and pleasantly brain-burny. In one mode players switch off being the “master builder,” which basically means they take turns declaring which resource will be placed that turn. In the second mode the burden of choosing is offloaded to a deck of resource cards. In the third you’re picking from three resource cards at a time, but also playing solo for a high score. That’s where the differences end, because every mode sees you taking that resource and placing it into an open spot. If a bunch of adjacent resources match the design on a building card, you sweep them all up and plop that building into one of the spaces where your resources were arranged.Oh, and this is all done simultaneously, with no significant downtime other than harassing whichever of your friends is taking too long deciding where to stash their glass. Like I said, it’s as simple as pastoral living, or at least some romanticized version of it.
Response number 2:
Fortunately, this process is tougher than it sounds. At first it’s an easy thing to hammer together a building, even one of the bigger ones. Before long, however, space becomes severely limited. A single misplaced cube might block off an entire quadrant, while an errant building fails to line up its bonuses with what you’re building nearby. Soon you’re making trade-offs or struggling to mitigate your previous shortsightedness.Speaking of which, we should talk about the buildings, since they’re the beating heart of this thing. Crucially, each game of Tiny Towns is played with seven public buildings, and other than the lowly cottage you’re never guaranteed the same options. There are two dozen of these public buildings, yet the game remains balanced because you’re always provided one of each type — farming, religious, entertainment, and so forth. Within those broad archetypes, there’s some clever variety. Take commercial buildings, for example. Where one play features a Bakery, which earns points by being situated directly next to farming or industrial building, the next might utilize a Theater, pulling in points for every unique building type in its row or column, or a Tailor, worth extra if it’s in the middle of town.And every match has six of these types, with four cards apiece, meaning that every combination presents a fresh challenge. One game will have you surrounding a Granary with Cottages with Wells, while the next might reward those who use a Trading Post to quickly build more Feast Halls than your neighbor. Each challenge is surprisingly different, despite revolving around the same basic premise that you’re gradually painting yourself into a corner with the same paint that’s scoring you heaps of points.“Aha!” you might be saying. “If this is done simultaneously, with everyone using the same resource and same selection of buildings, what’s to prevent everyone from taking exactly the same move?”Good question, Geoff. And beyond the simplest answer, that people are not automatons but women and men with agency both moral and tetrahedral, Tiny Towns answers this query with one more type of card — and it’s simultaneously one of the game’s best ideas and one of its most precarious balancing acts.
Response number 3:
Monuments are a brilliant idea. Each player receives their own, in secret, and is allowed to either build it or not. These are far wilder than their basic brethren, both in terms of their construction and what they provide when finished. The Obelisk of the Crescent lets you place all future buildings anywhere, rather than only where their constituent resources were. Barrett Castle eats as much as two additional cottages but provides extra points if fed by nearby farms. The Starloom awards bonus points if you finish your town early, effectively removing the sting of finding yourself in that corner with paint on your shoes. There are loads to choose from, and all bend the rules in their own way.Not that they necessarily bend the rules in ways that always feel fair. I’m loathe to complain about balance, especially in a game that feels so defiantly symmetrical at every other point. But that symmetry exacerbates even the slightest advantage, especially in a puzzle as exacting as this one, and it’s frustrating to feel hemmed in by a tough monument rather than liberated with one that might score a tidy heap of points.Then again, that bare filament of individuality is so essential to ensuring that not everybody pursues exactly the same strategy that I’m tempted to write it off as a minor problem. Most of my plays have been determined by whomever most smartly combines that match’s selection of buildings. If the occasional game should come down to a nice synergy between your monument and what’s out there, well, that’s a small price to pay.
Response number 4:
By and large, Tiny Towns defies its plain-Jane presentation with some thinky spatial puzzling, variable scoring, and even a dash of hidden individuality. In one sense it reminds me of a roll-and-write game, with everybody laboring from an identical procession of resources and opportunities. It also suffers from some of that genre’s staidness, sometimes coming across as a punitive slog when a sticky resource choice presents itself or a past decision comes back to bite you. But those moments seem to be the exceptions; most of the time, it’s a serviceable and even interesting heads-down puzzle that rewards forward planning and careful arrangement.Not my favorite, in other words. But far from a bad time.This review was originally published at Space-Biff!, so if you like what you see, please head over there for more. https://spacebiff.com/2019/04/22/tiny-towns/Also, I suppose I ought to plug my Geeklist of reviews: https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/169963/space-biff-histori...

Reviews,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2208048/clear-eyes-tiny-towns-cant-lose-a-review,"Title: Clear Eyes, Tiny Towns, Can't Lose: A Review
Original post: Tiny Towns starts with an empty 4x4 grid, an empty slate, full of potential. The first few turns feel open and free as resources take up spaces on the grid. A building or two pops up on the landscape; things really feel like they're coming together. Your tiny town is taking shape. You have a few key resources positioned exactly where you need them to execute your plan. The person to your left calls out ""Wheat!"" You didn't want a wheat, but you still have space for it. The next player calls out ""Wheat!"" Things are starting to get a little dicey - looks like you're going to have to build a farm. ""Stone!"" The dread sets in as you search for a spot to hide a stone in your town where it won't ruin your plans. All you need is a brick, just one brick and you can work your way of of this jam. ""Wood!"" Wood?! What kind of monster needs wood right now? You place the wood, tuck it away where it can't hurt your future plans, a resource taking up space, eventually turning into a negative point. Finally, it's your turn, you call out ""Brick!"" and turn four resources into a barn. You wanted to build the cottage, but you needed to free up the space for the barn. You hear the groans of others, as pained to place a brick as you were that wood. There lies the beauty, the triumph, the pain, the misery of Tiny Towns. Tiny Towns is easy to teach, easy to learn, and easy to play. It can also be extremely difficult. Every decision you make can send you down a path to victory or plummeting toward defeat. Naming a resource, placing a resource, and converting resources into building couldn't be easier. Placing your resources in the right spot, planning ahead, and accounting for the decisions others make when naming resources is where all the difficulty lies- but it's the best kind of difficulty. What starts out as a blank canvas ready for your creativity quickly becomes a cramped, bloated, cumbersome map teetering on the edge of disaster. The agonizing decisions, anticipation when relying on the decisions of your opponents, and satisfaction of pulling off the right move at the right time elevates Tiny Towns above its simplicity. As far as components go, the resource cubes are resource cubes - nothing you haven't seen before. The building meeples are nice looking, detailed,  and really add a feeling of completion to your town as it grows and expands from little cubes to big buildings. The building cards are nice and big, but can be difficult for everyone to see and read with a table full of six players. Having four choices for most of the buildings also adds variability and prevents the game from getting stuck with a single dominant strategy. The art on the box and cards is nice, but the theme of animals living in and building these towns doesn't feel prominent enough to matter. The art is nice, but it's mostly just buildings; however, this didn't detract from the game at all as I was too busy thinking about what resources I need and what buildings to build next. The player boards are simple, not adding much visually, but the size is nice and they act as a good backdrop to the resource cubes and buildings. Finally, the box isn't unnecessarily big and contains an insert that holds everything well - with one exception. I tried sleeving the resource card deck but the sleeves didn't quite fit in the insert without bending the excess sleeve. A small nit to pick for an insert that blows most inserts that come with games out of the water. As I've hinted at above, I love the tightness, quickness, and simplicity of Tiny Towns. As far as gameplay goes, I have very little negative to point out. The main aspect that stood out as a possible negative was the variance of the special buildings. Some building seem just plain better than others, whether through points or ease of building. However, that's really the only thing that stands out to me as a potential issue when it comes to gameplay. I could see certain groups getting bogged down with analysis paralysis or slowness when choosing resources or deciding where to place and build, but I found that even with six players the game went quickly and smoothly. Tiny Towns also includes a great solo mode. Choosing from three available resource cards does a good job of replicating the variance in playing against opponents, including stacking the deck against yourself if you get too greedy with choosing the same resource multiple times in a row. I have found that my solo scores line up closely with my multiplayer scores, which was a pleasant surprise that leads me to think both methods of choosing resources provide variance and difficulty. On top of that, there are more variants included in the game to alter the way resources are chosen that I have yet to explore. I look forward to exploring more of what this game has to offer and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a simple game that can really make your head hurt.

Response number 2:
I picked up Tiny Towns about a month ago knowing nothing about it other than people seemed to think it was good. Since then it has been hands down my most played game of the past month. One thing that helps here is the varied player count: it plays well (and fairly quickly!) at all player counts from 2 to 6. That’s pretty remarkable in and of itself. The other contributing factor here though, is that I just want to keep playing it! It really is unlike any other game I’ve played, for a number of reasons, which keep me coming back to it again and again. Let me tell you about it…The ruleset is very simple. Each player is attempting to fill a grid (their tiny town) in front of each of them with buildings. Different building score points in different ways and most points wins at the end. On your turn, you name a resource (brick, wood, stone, etc.) and everyone has to take one of those resources and place it in their town on one space (you can never have more than one thing in a space).Turns procede round the table until you’ve managed to arrange the right resources in the right pattern to make a building. For example (see image), to construct a Bakery, you need a yellow, two red and a blue resource in the pictured pattern. Patterns can be rotated or even reflected, so there’s more freedom than you might think to make the patterns. To build the building, you remove all the resources from their spaces and replace one of those spaces with the appropriate building token.
Response number 3:
You can see at the bottom of the Bakery card, it will score you 3 points at the end of the game as long as it is next to certain other buildings. Sounds simple enough right? At the start of the game, it really is. Just wait though: it gets much more difficult later on.The rules don’t get any more complicated, but as your board starts to fill up, it becomes very hard to fit the right patterns in to make more buildings. Sometimes you need to make a different building to the one you intended, just to remove the resources and free up space. You see, if you completely fill your board (usually with a mixture of buildings and resources that you haven’t managed to convert into buildings yet) then your game is over. You remove all the resources you weren’t able to convert into buildings and each empty space on your board is minus one VP at the end.Everyone continues without you until everyone has filled their board and then you score up to see who wins. Being the last person to fill up their board is very powerful because you can keep choosing resources without other people picking resources that don’t help you. Each game has a selection of 7 building cards that remain fixed for the entire game. They each have different patterns and score in different ways, but you are selecting from a total of 25 possible building cards each game, so there’s lots of variety from game to game.The trick with the game is dealing with the resources that other people choose. You might be building a Bakery that requires wheat, brick and glass, but if someone else is trying to build a Farm that requires wheat and wood, you’ll be fine when they pick wheat, but what are you going to do when they pick wood? You see, you have to place that wood in your town somewhere. You could try building a Farm like them, but that might not fit with your point-scoring strategy. Or you could try building something else, but what if people aren’t picking the right resources for that building either? It’s very easy to get caught out later on in the game. You really need to pay attention to what other people are doing.It’s definitely more strategic with fewer players. With larger player counts you have to wait longer before you get to choose a resource so we use an extra rule that allows you not to place a resource that someone else picks throughout the game on two occasions. It’s not much, but in those situations where someone’s choice would stuff you up royally, it can be a life saver.The strategic decisions involved in picking a good combination of buildings to score you the most points are solid and common to many Euros, but add in the spatial element, the need to pay assiduous attention to other people’s boards and sometimes adapt your strategy on the fly and it becomes another beast altogether. It’s much thinkier than it appears at first and really benefits from repeat play.And yet, the rules are so simple. I think it’s a masterstroke of a game. Any perceived randomness comes from other people’s choices, but you can usually work out what they will choose if you watch carefully. It can be brutal for beginners though, so be aware of that!Have you managed to try this one yet? Does it appeal?
Response number 4:
I have 12 plays logged since it came out. It's definitely good, but I do believe that Master Builder should only be used at counts up to 4 with the Town Hall variant used for 5-6 player games. This fixes the issue that you felt obliged to house rule.

Isn't he just referring to the official Cavern variant which comes with the game. [BGG files section even has nice little cards you can print out to track the refused cubes.]I also always play with this option when playing with 5 players and sometimes 4 players. The TownHall variant has the downside of removing all player interaction in the game.

Reviews,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3358622/i-recommend-tiny-towns,"Title: I recommend Tiny Towns
Original post: I recommend Tiny Towns. This simple and quick game has 1 to 6 players competing in a simple geometric puzzle. This game takes the classic Puerto Rico or Race for the Galaxy style role selection mechanism and adds a really fun twist. Each player just chooses the color of resource that everyone must place on their own board. Make simple shapes, win simple prizes. 	The variable setup really keeps this rather simple game from feeling easily solvable, though in my limited experience some setups inevitably end up with some sort of strongest strategy. The strong parallelism is broken by a single player power option dealt out randomly at the start of the game. These add just enough texture so that between that and the tendency for people to prioritize different parts first keep the game from ending in a lot of ties.	The accessibility of this game is definitely one of the things that draws me to it. When I introduced it to my most common gaming partners, they immediately told me that needed to be an auto-include for any of our potential game gatherings. It can be explained in a few minutes, and people really grok it about halfway into their first game. Occasionally the interpretation of scoring on a card or two can be a bit tricky, but they are all simply explained to anyone who has questions.	Tiny Towns lives up to its name, and  in addition plays quickly. Every time I've played it the group immediately wanted to shuffle up and play again. Only time limits or the pre-plan to move onto another game stop the onslaught. The game is so simple but makes you think and plan ahead in such a deliciously tense way.  So overall, I really think you should have Tiny Towns on hand for a filler, a good intro game, or for a marathon of only this game. It fills so many roles, and nobody needs to be left out.

Original post: Tiny towns is a city-building and resource-management game for one to six players, published in 2019 by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG). The small animals of the forest have discovered tiny areas which are hidden from predators, each of which could conceal, as the name suggests, a Tiny Town. Each player oversees the planning of such a town, making use of available resources and severely limited space to construct buildings on their city boards. Players earn victory points through the construction and strategic placement of these buildings, and the winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.Components* 1 full-color, profusely illustrated rulebook* 6 player city boards, each depicting a 4x4 grid* 25 building cards* 15 monument cards* 126 wooden building tokens * 6 monument tokens* 1 wooden Master Builder hammer* 90 wooden resource cubes* 1 scorepadGame PlayEach player is given a city board depicting a 4x4 grid, on which the Tiny Towns will be built. There is a supply of colored cubes representing the five resources in the game: wood, wheat, brick, glass, and stone. Players take turns being the Master Builder; the Master Builder dictates which resource all players must take on that turn and place somewhere on their city board.The colors of the resource cubes match the colors the building cards. There are eight classes of building cards in the game: the cottage, well, factory, theater, chapel, tavern, farm, and monuments. Any player can build any of these types of buildings.The cottage is a class by itself; there is only one cottage card, and it is used in every game. The game includes four variants for each of next six classes of buildings in the list. For example, farm-type building cards include the Farm, Granary, Greenhouse, and Orchard, each of which requires slightly different resources to construct, and is scored differently, but all four are represented by the same red building token. Only one card from each class is used in any given game, so if you've included a Granary, you can't add a farm. Lastly, the game includes monument cards, each of which requires a unique resource configuration and provides a unique ability. At the start of the game, each player is provided two monument cards. Each must select one monument from those two, which is kept secret until the monument is constructed. A player may only construct the monument depicted on their monument card, not  monument cards held by other players.Remember how the player in the role of Master Builder dictates what color of resource cube players take each turn? To construct a building, you must take whatever resource the Master Builder chooses (including turns during which you are the Master Builder) and put it somewhere on your city board. Be careful where you put the resource cubes, because they can’t be moved once placed. As additional resources are chosen, you can form patterns on your board that match the color configurations on the building cards. When you’ve managed to create the configuration pictured on one of the building cards – it doesn’t matter if your cubes are placed exactly as pictured, rotated, or laid out in a mirror image – you can construct that building. When you construct, you remove all resource cubes from your board that match the building pattern, then place the token matching that building type on one of the spaces formerly occupied by one of those resource cubes. Not only do you have to be mindful of which resources to lay out to construct a building, you must ensure that the placement of the building tokens on your city grid are optimal for scoring. The Well, for example, is worth more points for each adjacent cottage (Note: in this game, “adjacent” means being placed orthogonally next to something. Diagonal adjacency isn’t scored). The Farm feeds four cottages on your grid, regardless of their location, while the Theater awards points based on the number of unique building types in the same row and column of your city board.At the end of the game, players can compute their scores using the pad of score sheets provided with the game. Points are awarded for each building type, and are deducted for building factories, for having empty spaces, or spaces with unused resources on a city board. The pad isn’t necessary – it would be easy enough to use scratch paper – but it makes what would otherwise be the most difficult part of the game easy. No excuses for not playing!Lastly, the game comes with two variant rule sets. The first, the Town Hall Rules, eliminates the role of Master Builder in favor of resources randomly drawn from a deck of cards. The second is a solitaire variant, which is convenient for solo gaming or learning the rules before playing with a group.EvaluationProsSimplicity. The game is easy to learn and teach. The rules are covered in only eight pages with lots of illustrations, and three of those pages include a card index, rules variants, and publishing credits. Scalability. The game scales perfectly to any player count.Quality. The cards are printed on a durable stock and given a satin finish. The player boards are thick with a linen finish, and all other components are painted wood. Tiny Towns can take a lot of punishment and the components will still look good. Player agency. The Master Builder and construction mechanics ensure that all players make decisions every turn. Players advance their construction on every turn, whether they are Master Builder or not. Contrast these mechanics with turn-based games during which you must wait through all of your opponents’ turns until you can finally act on your own turn. In addition to being able to act every turn, players know that each decision will impact the outcome of the game. There are no unimportant decisions to make.Replayability. Having multiple variations for the different building tokens and so many unique monuments provides for a tremendous level of variety between games, and that variety doesn’t even factor in the available expansions. Choice of play style: The rules as written allow for limited player conflict, since players can use the Master Builder mechanic to sabotage other players. Early in the game, there is enough space on the city boards for everyone to have a few different buildings under construction at once, so what the Master Builder chooses doesn't impact play much. Later in the game, space is at a premium, and it's possible to deduce what an opponent is building by comparing the building cards on the table and the resources the opponent is placing. If you're master builder, you can deliberately choose a resource that would ruin an opponent's ability to finish what is obviously under construction. You can even take turns as Master Builder when your own city board is full of buildings and resources, so long as at least one opponent can still place a resource cube. Some players will be relieved to know that the Town Hall Rules Variant eliminates this player competition. By replacing the role of Master Builder with a special Resource Deck, composed of cards depicting random resources, the Town Hall rules require all players to build from exactly the same resources on exactly the same turns without interference from each other.Cons* Weak theme. Games involving settlements for cute, fuzzy woodland creatures have become fashionable, judging by the success of games like Everdell and Root. Like most Eurogames, the theme of Tiny Towns is pasted on - it works for woodland creatures, but changing the art would make it also work for building a sci-fi colony on a hostile planet, building a secret community while hiding from an oppressive government, or building a boat to escape a desert island. Tiny Towns feels like a low-budget Everdell left in the sun too long, and players who gravitate toward thematic games will probably shrug their shoulders at this one.* Solo mode is too easy. It is really easy to do really well in solo mode. The solo mode does play almost exactly like the regular game, and AEG should be credited for that, but the downside is that the solo rules provide almost no challenge. I was left with the impression that the solo rules were added for marketing purposes instead of the designers wanting to create an immersive solitaire experience.I see much more to like than dislike in this offering from AEG. Tiny Towns is easy to teach, highly replayable, durable, and plays equally well at any player count. The price is competitive. The appeal is broad. The drawbacks are few and not significant. In all, a game worth buying and keeping.

Original post: (Originally posted on www.boardgamegumbo.com with pictures!)My wife is a teacher, so gaming during the school year can be pretty limited. If we want a game to hit the table, it has to fit a few criteria: (a) playable in under an hour (Dice Hate Me’s famous “One Hour Wonders” are particularly attractive to us); (b) interesting mechanically; and (c) plays well at two.We’ve had a bunch of games rotate through our Thursday night date night / weekend gaming catalog. But I am always scouring the internet and game group plays for more choices, as usually my wife burns out after six or ten or twelve plays of a game.That’s why I got excited when AEG sent me a review copy of Tiny Towns. First, and this is a blanket shill, the designer Peter McPherson, will be on Gumbo Live! in a few weeks. (Tuesday night, April 30th to be exact.) Second, I asked Peter to be on the show because I had spied a few early plays of the game on social media, and figured it would be right up my wife’s alley. Finally, the production quality when I opened up the box screamed something that would look good on the table and be enticing to my wife.Does your game group like spatial puzzle games? Do they get their juices flowing when you lay a town building game on the table? Well then, spice up your game night with Tiny Towns.Tiny Towns is a 2019 release from AEG for one to six players, designed by Peter McPherson, with fun art from Gong Studios and Matt Paquette. Players take on the roles of little countryside mayors who compete to create a tiny little town on their four by four player board. Players will take turns calling out the building materials that will be used each turn by all players, and then try to complete one of the seven available buildings or their personal monument. They will take a negative hit for any empty spaces at the end of the game, but the mayor who scores the most amount of VPs is declared the winner.PRESENTATION:AEG’s recent releases have had impressive production value, and Tiny Towns is no exception. The box contains a smorgasbord of wooden pieces in bright colors, each one a model for a different type of building. There are seven (eight if you count the monument variant) different types of buildings represented in the game, everything from churches to taverns. The pieces are easy to distinguish, and even the plain little grey discs are thematic in that they stand for little but necessary additions to your town like wells and fountains.Up to six players can play, and each player gets a nice thick piece of cardboard with a four by four grid on one side. Each building is first represented by a tarot sized reference card, which shows four things: (a) the type of building (represented by its color); (b) the type of construction materials needed; (c) the pattern of those materials that need to be placed; and (d) the special ability players get for building the building. The tarot cards are large, colorful, and some have really cute art of woodland animals representing your town folk. (Minor complaint – more woodland creatures art would have been a plus.)Each building type has four different variants, but only one of each building type / color is used during a game. The eighth building type may be my favorite part of the game: there is an optional rule that will be discussed below for players to build “monuments”, which are represented by tall purple rook type pieces. In short, this is a great production with chunky and plentiful wooden pieces, multiple types of buildings within each category, and plain but sturdy player boards.GAMEPLAY:Tiny Towns presents an interesting spatial puzzle for players. Each round, players will take turns acting as the “Master Builder”, calling out one of the five resources available in the game, each represented by a differently colored cube. That call forces all players to take one of those resources from the supply, and place it on the board. That’s right -- players basically spend the entire game placing other players’ choices of resources on their player board.If a player has a pattern of resources on the four by four grid that matches one of the buildings on the tableau, then that player can replace all of those resources with the one building. But placing that building has consequences.Some of the buildings generate victory points, some generate special abilities, and some support other buildings. (For instance, cottages score points but only if they are fed by farms, which usually do not score points on their own.) The designer has a cool variant, too, where each player has a secret “monument” (with whimsical names on about half of them) that is known only to the player. Each monument is different, and either scores big points or has cool abilities that can really change up a player’s strategy.As the resources populate the board, players face delicious decisions. Trade in the resources for a certain building? But where on the board? (Buildings take the spot of only one of the resources, and the rest of the resources are put back into the supply.) Does this decision leave room for more buildings to be built? Does it match the bonus powers on the cards? Players have to keep an eye out for what other players are building, or else risk going all around the table placing resources that are completely unhelpful to their grid until it is their turn again.Players will continue placing resources, trading them in for a building, and focusing on the next building to build until they have no more legal moves. It is always interesting to watch the players realize that a board that is filling up quickly will have plenty of room once one of the larger buildings takes the place of four or five resources. Once all players have run out of legal moves, the game ends. Note: one of the advantages to being the last person to fill up the board is that once all other players finish, the last person can essentially call out all the resources for a few turns until the game board is filled up without worrying about resources that do not match the goal.I also recommend one more variant that is mentioned in the rules. Instead of players having to play every resource that is called out by each player each round, the designer suggests a “cavern” rule. Each player has a “cavern” where you can “bury” two resources during the game. In other words, twice per game, players can choose to refuse to play a resource on the board if it will mess up the grid in the short term or their long term strategy on building certain buildings.When I read the rule, I worried that utilizing the cavern would make the game too easy. But I’ve played multiple times with and without the cavern rule, and my worries were for naught. The real fun in this game is not only the crunchy decisions as to where the pieces should be played, but also the absolutely comboliciousness that comes when you can pull off a particular difficult set up of resources to score the building you need or place your monument. Your mileage may vary.BUT IS IT FUN?Before I give you my thoughts, here’s a caveat. I have played Tiny Towns at two players and four players only. Unfortunately, I had to leave our Brew & Board Games night early last week because of broadcasting duties and did not get to play a larger count game as I had planned to do. But, based on my plays, I do not think my thoughts will change with any 4+ player count games for the reasons discussed below. (If I get a chance to play this week, I’ll update my thoughts later.)Tiny Towns fires on a number of cylinders that calls to me and my wife. My wife commented to me after the first game that she enjoyed the spatial aspects of the puzzle, even if her score was not equal to her enthusiasm. Her affection was not a surprise to me at all; in fact, I kind of expected it. We both like spatial puzzle games like Qwirkle or New York: 1901 or any of Uwe Rosenberg’s recent polyomino games.The first time we played Tiny Towns together, we were admittedly floundering around in terms of resource and building placement. I could see as the game progressed that she was really concentrating hard on fitting the buildings in the market to the design she had laid out with her resources. I think we were both so focused on building our respective monuments that we lost sight of the rest of the connectivity in the game. Needless to say, we got better and better at this as each game progressed.I also love the scalability of the game. Since all players are essentially playing at the same time – there might be a slight wait when one player is agonizing over a decision where to put a particular resource or whether to cash in for a certain building – the game plays equally well at two or four players. Even when players are eliminated as they complete their grid and have no more legal moves, it does not feel like true player elimination. The end of the game comes quickly enough. Since it takes a little bit of time to score each player on the handy score sheets provided by the publisher in the box, the player who finishes first will find there is just enough time to score her tableau.My wife and I enjoyed the game so much that we made it a point to try each and every building included in the game, some multiple times. That speaks to the replayability of Tiny Towns. Each building type is represented by four different variants, and that does not even consider the big stack of monuments that are included and how they each interact with the buildings. We home brewed a variant that required that we draw two monuments but they had to be two we had never played before, just to try out some of the various combos and strategies. As you can see, there are a lot of plays in the box, because each combination of building types synchs up differently with the various monuments, so the game constantly refreshes itself. But, there’s even room for expansion if the designer has a few ideas up his sleeve.A frequent question I’ve seen online is whether there is enough player interaction in Tiny Towns. My wife is not a big fan of “take that” games, but she doesn't mind a little bit of player interaction. Typically, euros like this are “multi-player” solitaire (think Karuba, for instance, where the only interaction comes with trying to figure out when to make a run at a temple or when to hang back and grab some more gems based on the relative position of the other players’ adventurers on their “map”). Tiny Towns disguises the solitaire nature of the game very well with one clever trick. Instead of randomly flipping over resources (which is a variant we have never tried, using an included deck of resource cards), players take turns calling out the resources that will be played on the player boards that turn.I can smell the roux thickening up on the juicy decisions that this twist suggests in your mind. The game basically tests and teases you at the same time. Are you agile enough to see what resources you need that others may call out on their turns, while you call a resource on your turn that only you need? That kind of quick thought processing did not happen for us on the first or second game, but within a few games, we were keeping tabs on each other’s boards in that fashion. (In a multiplayer game, the best I could do was watch the person to the left and right of me.)So there’s a lot to like about Tiny Towns. I guess one could quibble that some of the buildings resemble each other, so sometimes we grabbed the wrong one during play. One could also argue that some of the monuments seem much more powerful than others. That would imply that there could have been a touch more development. A stronger complaint might be in the aforementioned limited player interaction. To some gamers, “hate drafting” resources will not scratch enough of the player interaction itch. But, those are minor complaints. Really, this is a very good presentation of a type of game that is right in my wheelhouse.One final warning: if it isn’t plainly obvious from the game play overview or the chatter, you better like tetris type puzzle mechanisms if you are going to enjoy your time with Tiny Towns. The heart of the game is essentially placing resources and buildings more efficiently than your opponents as well as spotting the synergies between the buildings available on the board and how they relate to your own monument. Does answering those kinds of questions speak to you? If not, then shake the dust off your sandals and this is probably not your kind of game. But if your heart skips a beat anytime a new town building game comes out, and you’d love to own a replayable game that has some surprising depth in a tiny little twenty-to-forty minute package, then you should check out Tiny Towns.Just don’t get mad at me if that thirty minute play time becomes nearly two hours when you say thrice, “let’s do that again.”

Original post: Full review here:https://svsjboardgames.com/2021/03/12/tiny-towns/Tiny Towns is one of those beautifully simple games that is perfect for beginning or ending a games night, whatever the group of people you have around the table. It’s been one of our main go-to games for a well over a year now so I thought I should probably give it a review!You are the mayor of a tiny town, hoping to use any building resources that come your way to construct buildings and score points to win the game! Beware though, wasted resources cost you points at the end of the game…Space is tight in your town, with just a 4×4 grid to work from, so plan carefully to avoid getting yourself stuck with nowhere to build!How the game worksYou score points by constructing different buildings in your town, and each building has a different resource cost. You lay out the necessary resources in the correct pattern in order to place the building. For example, a Cottage requires an L shape of wheat, glass and brick in order to construct whereas a Fountain just needs a stone and a wood.How do you get resources? You get to pick them! Well, you take it in turns to pick them. At the start, the first player picks a resource and everyone then places that resource somewhere in their 4×4 grid tiny town. Then the next player picks, and so on. After you’ve placed a resource you might find you’re able to construct one of the buildings on offer, so you swap the resources for the matching building. Place the building somewhere in your town (it has to be on one of the spots the resources were on), and then get back to placing resources.Placement is key as you can no longer place resources on a square that has a building in it, so chucking a church in one of the middle four squares early on might not be the best move! Also, most of the buildings score points depending on where in your town they are placed, so think about that too.The buildings change each game so that you always have one of each type in the game. Cottages (light blue) are in every game and score lots of points as long as they are “fed”, but every other building type changes.You keep taking it in turns to place resources, constructing buildings when you can, until your town gradually fills up. Once you can’t place any more resources, you’re out and everyone else continues until they’re unable to go. Then you score points for your buildings and lose points for every space without a building. Sounds simple! And it is, that’s why its so fun!ReviewI instantly loved Tiny Towns, it’s an easy game to learn and it’s really fun to play. Because there are four of each type of building there’s a tonne of replayability, which is increased by the fifteen purple Monument buildings. Each player gets their own secret Monument at the start of the game, and once built it either provides points or an ongoing ability to that player. For example the Shrine of the Elder Tree gives you points depending on how late in the game you build it, and the Cathedral of Caterina means your empty spaces don’t cost you points at game’s end. This asymmetry really adds to the game experience for me, trying to second guess what your opponents’ Monuments are.We found that the Crescent of the Obelisk Monument card was overpowered as it allows the player to place future buildings wherever they want in their town, freeing them up to move awkward buildings to the corners and sides no matter where the resources were placed.The artwork on the box and cards is very charming and appealing, and the building miniatures are wonderful! It’s a really pleasant game to look at.There’s a really nice balance to the game, between picking resources you desperately need, and not picking resources your opponents’ desperately need. For example if you’re building a cottage and you need glass, wheat and brick, you look at your neighbour and if they desperately need glass and brick to finish off their Tavern, you could pick wheat to force them into placing it somewhere, hopefully clogging up their town!If the “take that” nature of Tiny Towns doesn’t appeal, you can play the alternate variant where a deck of cards dictates the resources you all place (every third placement can be the resource of your choice). This can be infuriating as “yet another” stone comes out when you have no use for it in your town!We’ve found this is the perfect game to teach people who are relatively new to gaming due to its simplicity and its good looks!A major positive for me in this game is there’s very little downtime. It’s simultaneous play so you’re all doing something all the time. The only occasions you might be waiting is if some overly-analytical player is scratching their head over where to place a resource (I’m looking at you Joel!), but generally its super quick and the 45 minutes on the box is an overestimate. If you’re out first you have to wait for the other players to finish, but unless you’ve completely messed up (Jack’s all-time low score of minus 1 has gone down in Tiny Towns history), you all generally finish your towns at the same time so you shouldn’t have long to wait.Tiny Towns technically can be played solo, but it doesn’t really change the rules (you have to play the variant rather than picking your own resources every turn – for obvious reasons), so it’s not particularly exciting as you’re just playing against yourself (there’s no way of winning or losing, just beating your own score).I’d struggle to find a better 30 minute game that appeals to such a wide range of gamers, especially one that plays up to 6. Do yourself a favour and grab yourself a copy!

Reviews,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2216006/tiny-towns-review-played-this-8-times-in-2-days-it,"Title: Tiny Towns Review - Played this 8 times in 2 days. It was great!
Original post: Tiny Towns arrived at my doorstep 2 nights ago to much eager anticipation and I have already played it 8 times since. Wow. This game ticked so many boxes for me. The spatial puzzle to fit resources into a small 4x4 grid as your town gets more and more crowded is amazing. The 'Master Builder' mode which is the default mode in the ruleset allows for great interaction between players. The feeling when you call out a resource colour (e.g. Bricks) when your opponents' boards are already filled to the brim with bricks is satisfyingly naughty. Overview and Rules Summary - You are the mayor of a tiny town (a puny 4x4 grid!) and are working towards fame by building buildings in the most point-efficient way - each building type has a specific requirement for scoring (e.g. cottages need to be fed, markets need to be placed next to each other etc.) Every game, there is a unique combination of buildings that you and your friends can build, each having a unique blueprint that specifies the types and sequence of resources required. Additionally, each player receives a 'one-time use' monument building that can be built to help carve out your niche and develop your long term strategy.Players take turns in clockwise order to be the Master Builder. As the Master Builder, you call out a resource type (e.g. Brick). Everyone at the table then proceeds to place a Brick onto their town. Once your resources match a blueprint of a building, you can convert it into a building. Buildings give points or they power your other buildings. However, they also block out 1 of 16 precious spaces on your board, reducing your real estate slowly but surely. Players continue placing and converting resources on the board until they are unable to do so anymore and they are out of the game. Once everyone is unable to add anything further to their board, the game ends and everyone counts up the scores of their buildings and gets a 1 point penalty for each space not covered by a building. Why I love this game?- Bingo-style turns but a brain-mushingly satisfying puzzle. Conceptually easy to explain to new gamers and crunchy enough for experienced ones. Low rules overhead but overflowing with decisions in the middle segment of the game. - Player Interaction that is meaningful but does not feel particularly nasty. - Plays up to 6 players with little downtime as you put down resource cubes even when you are not the master builder. - Variety of building cards. There are 7 types of buildings of which 6 types have 4 cards each, and there is a stack of monument cards that are distributed randomly to players at the start of the game. - A 'Townhall' Variant for those who want to have a more solitaire feel to the game. The game comes with a stack of cards depicting resources. Each round, instead of having the Master Builder decide the resource, the deck does it instead. After every 2 cards, each player gets to pick a wild resource to put down. This way, you cannot affect your opponents' gameplay.What could have been better?- Some iconography on the cards to complement the text would have made explanation easier as most of the complexity of the game comes down to the building effects. - At 6 players, personal agency is decreased leaving some players with dead spaces very quickly. However, there is a 'cavern' variant, where you have some slots to trash your unwanted resources. We have not yet played with this. - With a big group, it is hard to track if every player has taken the resource cubes before moving on to the next round. This is important because in the game, almost every cube placement has a big impact on your final outcome. Final ThoughtsAll in all, this is a game that I am confident will stay on my shelf for a long time. I can pull this out with anyone and I am certain that even those of a younger age group will be able to grasp the concepts quickly. The satisfaction of making efficient moves and chaining your buildings together is great, but a wrong move could bring about great frustration. New players may get frustrated when rushed to make a decision as misplacing their cubes could end the game for them prematurely. To avoid disappointment when introducing to new players, the host can provide advice while they are playing and slow down the game.Hope you enjoyed that review. Cheers!

Then, since it is worth 2 cottages, another 6 points since it was fed. This seems to be doubling-dipping. The player was smart to also have built 3 chapels, gaining 6 more points from this “2 cottage” equivalent.Are we misunderstanding the scoring for this monument card?

Original post: Does the contiguous group needing to be fed need to be the same type of building?for example, will [cottage]-[barret castle]-[cottage] all be fed? similarly will the two cottages in [cottage]-[well]-[cottage] be fed?Thank you!
Response number 1:
The only building that needs to be fed are the cottages. So the cottages themselves need to be contiguous.
Response number 2:
The barret castle also needs to be fed for points. Also there's a language difference between one of the monuments and the greenhouse. The monument says something on the lines of ""largest contiguous group of the same type"" where as the green house doesn't make that same distinction ""feeds 1 contiguous group of buildings"" Hope that clarifies my queries.
Response number 3:
Does the contiguous group needing to be fed need to be the same type of building?for example, will [cottage]-[barret castle]-[cottage] all be fed? similarly will the two cottages in [cottage]-[well]-[cottage] be fed?Thank you!
Response number 4:
[cottage]-[barret castle]-[cottage] = works since they are buildings that “need to be fed”[cottage]-[well]-[cottage] does not work
Response number 5:
Many thanks josh!

Rules,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2798176/feast-hall-points,"Title: Feast Hall Points
Original post: Our family had a disagreement on how to score multiple Feast Hall buildings last night (not a two player game).The text on the card says: 2 VP. +1 if you have more [Feast Hall] than the player on your right.If you don't have the most then you get 2 VP per Feast Hall.If you have the most:1. You get 2 VP per Feast Hall, and 1 additional VP.2. You get 3 VP per Feast Hall.As an example, let's say you have two Feast Halls and you have more than the person on your right. Based on the above options, that would be:1. 5 VP2. 6 VPI assumed #2 is the correct interpretation as the cards refer to each individual building you build unless otherwise stated (like a table of points based on number constructed). However, others in my family interpret the ""+1 if you have more"" as one of those statements not referring to an individual building. And now I can sort of see this because why not just make the card: ""2 VP. 3VP if you have more [Feast Hall] than the player on your right"" to make it extra clear?
Response number 1:
We've always played following #2, but you raise a good point about just saying ""3 VP if you have more than the player to your right.""However, I think #2 is still correct because I believe you always score each building individually  unless otherwise stated, as you said. I'd be interested in what others think though.
Response number 2:
My partner brought up another point: buildings like Tailor say ""1VP. +1VP for each [Tailor] in the 4 center squares in your town.""If you interpret this card following #1, then you only can get a maximum of 4 bonus VP if you have 4 Tailors in the center squares of your town and that all your Tailors are only worth a single point. E.g. 4 Tailors in the center of your town + 2 extra Tailors = 10VP, which feels very low considering it would take up 6/16 squares on your board.
Response number 3:
That's a good point and I've seen the threads on the Tailor that do say it follows #2. I understand in that case why it says +1 since it matters how many Tailors there are. I still feel like the +1 is confusing with Feast Hall if only because it's either 1 or 0, but I get that maybe it's trying to be consistent here.
Response number 4:
According to the card clarifications in the rule book, it would be in line with #2.If you are tied with the player on your right, your feast halls are 2 points.2 player ...If you have the most your feast halls are 3 pointsIf you are tied your feast halls are 2 pointsIf you have the least your feast halls are 2 points.
Response number 5:
I saw this clarification (we read it during the game and it didn't help us) and I wondered why they called out those specific things for 2 players since if you go by interpretation #2 then it would work for 2 players just the same. No clarification necessary.So did they call out 2 players to give an exception (which would actually go against #2) or just extra clarification that didn't seem to be needed (at least not *only* for 2 players) if you interpreted it correctly in the first place?
Response number 6:
I assumed they called out two players to use the words most and least ... in a game with more than 2, you don't need to have the most, just more than the person on your right. I could be wrong about that of course.
Response number 7:
I can see that, but in a 2 player game saying, ""more than the person on your right"" and ""the most"" are synonymous. Seems like the card as written works at any player count. To me the clarification just added confusion because I didn't see why they'd call out 2 players (or ties for that matter).
Response number 8:
That being said, rules are hard to write. It's hard to make them succinct and clear, hard to encompass all combinations especially when you have many cards with extra text, hard to know how people will interpret them, and something that's obvious to one person might not be to another.So I'm definitely not faulting the designers or writers here. This is probably our bad interpretation or being too pedantic. Just hoping to get clarification that #2 is correct (which I think it is, and sounds like others agree).
Response number 9:
Hey everyone #2 is correct you get 3VP for each of them. Just another clarification if you tie they are worth 2VP.
Response number 10:
Hey everyone #2 is correct you get 3VP for each of them. Just another clarification if you tie they are worth 2VP.

Response number 4:
Hi Pedro,whilst not disagreeing with you, the ""Building Clarifications"" on page 7 of the base game rules include the explanation, ""Adjacent refers to up, down, left, and right, not diagonal""  for the Granary, Greenhouse, Fountain, Well, Abbey and Bakery.This phrase is not included in the building clarification for the Millstone, which could suggest that the usual use of adjacent could apply (i.e. the dictionary definition of, ""next to or adjoining something else"") which could include diagonals. Why else would this clarification be omitted for the Millstone?My own personal take is that it was omitted in error; in Tiny Towns, adjacent ALWAYS refers to up, down, left, and right, not diagonalbut that could be considered a house rule.Have fun,Steve
Response number 5:
If I remember correctly, some buildings (like one or two monuments for example) will refer to ""all surrounding squares"" spaces, which would then include the diagonals.

Strategy,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2220976/only-one-winning-strategy,"Title: Only one winning strategy?
Original post: After 3rd play we realized we are only building cottages and occasionally Monuments combining with some green and grey buildings to utilize stone and wood. We literally never use other types of buildings as it seems less rewarding (takes more resources and effort to build for less points). Every time we push ourselves to use a different strategy and use other buildings we get lower score. 20 plays after we still didn’ figure out why would we use other buildings at all. Needless to say it makes the game a lot more shallow and samey. And it’s such a shame since we like the look and feel of the game a lot! What do we miss here?
Response number 1:
My first question would be, how are you feeding those cottages to ensure that they score points?
Response number 2:
We either add Red building or use Grand Mausoleum of Rodina (if lucky to draft it).So our final boards normally look like these: 1. As many Cottages as possible, one Red, Greys, optional Greens, optional Monument2. As many Cottages as possible, Grand Mausoleum of Rodina, optional Greens. And since most players go for the same types of buildings, we don’t struggle with utilising odd materials. And our final boards look very similar.
Response number 3:
You know it is 4 cottages per Farm, right?And why doesn’t another player hate draft against the others going blue/white/red for chapels and taverns?

Response number 11:
THIS. So much this. Some board game players have this tendency of deliberately ""trying various things"" and this impacts their view of the game. If the game collapses when played to win, then something's terribly wrong. That's not to say that Tiny Towns is (I haven't played it that much), but I just wanted to support the quoted view.
Response number 12:
Sorry it's feeling same-y to you, Katia. Cottage strategies require quite a lot of buildings to exceed 3VP per building. If you built 1 Farm, 4 Cottages, and 3 Wells, you could score a max of 12VP for the Cottages and 8VP for the Wells for a total of 20VP across 8 buildings for 2.5VP per building. Meanwhile, if one player managed to make 3 Tailors in the center of their board, they would score 12VP for an average of 4VP per building. And if they pull off 4 Tailors, that's 20 points for only 4 buildings--twice as efficient. It's true that the other buildings take more resources and effort, but a building that gobbles up more resources is a good thing--the bigger buildings you make, the longer you will be in the game. My recommendation is to try going for another strategy like Tailors, Markets, Cloisters, or Almshouses, all of which can be very lucrative. You will earn more VP per building than a straight Cottage strategy, and other players will be forced to cope with a lot of stone and wood that they will have to turn into low scoring Wells, Fountains, etc. I don't recommend this just to ""try a different strategy for variety""--in my experience, this really can earn you more VP than the other players, especially if they are only going for Cottages and Wells. If a group prefers one strategy, then their boards (and games) will be similar and it will become a matter of who can best execute that strategy. But one player going for something different can earn that player plenty of VP while hindering the strategy of the other players.I hope this freshens the game up a bit for you and your group!

I agree.  I’m at 6 plays now and I’m barely now starting to see the many different approaches.  The first couple of games I thought like OP, but as I’ve played I’ve noticed more and more intricacies, and that’s only playing with the same set of buildings, I haven’t even tapped into the different combinations available yet.No, there’s much more to this game.  Keep digging.
Response number 18:
I was about to start a new thread on a similar subject and just found this one. I have similar issues as the OP, I keep trying to build different buildings but in the end I keep getting beaten by cottages. I understand what you're saying, other buildings potentially get you more points, but I haven't found a way yet to make it work in practice. Cottages are very small, easy to build, are still worth a lot of points, and most importantly give you great flexibility with their three different colors of cubes. Other buildings potentially give you more points, it's true, but most often you must build a lot of them to make it work, and if you're the only one building them it will be hard and ultimately unlikely to succeed, since you're the only one calling for those cubes. In my last game, I started building Cloisters in the four corners, added a Theather into the mix, but by then I was starting to drown in yellow cubes from my opponent, which were only present in Cottage and Farm cards, so I had no use for them. By building cottages, you get a very reasonable 3 points AND you hinder your opponents by feeding them cubes they can't place if they're not also building cottages, usually yellow or red. This advantage must also be taken into consideration. Other buildings potentially give you more points, but only if you specialize and build a lot of them, which you're never going to achieve if you're alone going for that strategy. You will bust from an avalanche of blue, red or yellow cubes before succeeding. I would like to go for another strategy, but that's the only thing I can build with those cubes.That said, I still really like the game, I would simply appreciate getting that annoyance out of my mind. Should I just keep trying, and the problem will be resolved as I get better with the strategy? Should I try playing with a new group to get out of the ""cottage meta""?

Response number 20:
Use the card deck, it makes for nice strategic decisions and you can at least predict the probability of what cubes will be coming up.  I tried the calling out version but dont like it.  So many times its red, yellow, blue.. red, yellow, blue especially since were not the kind of players to deliberately screw each other left and right.
Response number 21:
Cottages are very small, easy to build...
Response number 22:
Against strong opponents, this is a weakness.Remember that it's an advantage to keep going as long as possible: once other players have folded, you get greater control over the building materials available.If you keep building Cottage, Well, Cottage, Well over and over, you'll have filled your board in around 40 turns. If you instead build a mixture of larger stuff, you could potentially last twice as long.
Response number 23:
if you're the only one building them it will be hard and ultimately unlikely to succeed, since you're the only one calling for those cubes
Response number 24:
That cuts both ways. If you call those cubes and nobody else has any use in mind for them, how are they going to get rid of them?
Response number 25:
I’ll keep that in mind next time I play. But last time I tried to go with the big buildings I ended up stuck with the cubes from my opponents cottages, and I ended up finishing way before my opponent instead of after her, and with -5 on top of it all because of those unused cubes. This probably has more to do with my poor planning than with the balance of the game, but do you see my point?
Response number 26:
In most of my games cottages have been the go-to strategy as well. It's especially bad when the red building is the granary, which feeds cottages in the 8 squares surrounding it. This makes a cottage strategy quite easy (and dull). As noted above, cottages are good value for their size and tend to pay out more reliably than other buildings (even a cloister strategy is riskier).I've also noticed that yellow buildings generally seem to be quite weak, with their bigger footprints and dodgier scoring conditions.
Response number 27:
Bigger footprint = better.
Response number 28:
If you keep building Cottage, Well, Cottage, Well over and over, you'll have filled your board in around 40 turns. If you instead build a mixture of larger stuff, you could potentially last twice as long.
Response number 29:
Unless I'm missing something, this argument doesn't hold water. What do you profit from ""lasting longer"", if the scoring is always calculated at the end and is a direct function of buildings on your board at the end (and not other actions done during the game)? If you can build your whole board efficiently, it will be reflected in your final score. Sure, if you become the last player, you can call the last cubes for yourself, but if other players managed to fill their board efficiently before that, it doesn't help you in any way.
Response number 30:
The thing is, most other buildings have the potential to score more than cottages do. The trick is to realise that potential.
Response number 31:
The profit?? If your last you choose all cubes!
Response number 32:
But if you’ve filled your board with your intended buildings, you don’t need cubes anymore.

If you play well, you still lots of space before he cottage playerz. ""get gud""

But if you’ve filled your board with your intended buildings, you don’t need cubes anymore.
Response number 35:
Have you actually been in a situation where your opponent finished earlier? Yesterday my wife filled her board way before me (with cottages/wells mainly), allowing me to call cubes for 4 new taverns I put on my board on 4 out of 5 remaining spaces in difficult places (would be impossible if she was still in the game). My score was 3x hers.
Response number 36:
In my last game, I started building Cloisters in the four corners, added a Theather into the mix, but by then I was starting to drown in yellow cubes from my opponent, which were only present in Cottage and Farm cards, so I had no use for them.
Response number 37:
I think you're touching upon a strategic point that hasn't really been mentioned. I've only played 6 or so games, but the one thing I feel you always need at the start of a game is a strategy for ""what do I do with cubes of each color"". If your strategy of building 3 types of buildings has no yellow cubes in it, then you're likely going to fail. And if the setup has yellow cubes in only two buildings, you probably need to include them in your strategy.

Hi! I know this post is very old but I am hoping someone swings by and helps me out! Can you please tell me how this town scored 44pts? If the Tailor shops are 1pt each, plus and extra 1 pt for each of the four Center ones then that would be 12 pts for those plus 4 pts for the millstones. 3 pts for the Inn. Then subtract 3 for empty spaces. So 16 pts. What am I missing?
Response number 7:
No, each tailor is worth 5 points, so that's 40 points on tailors alone. You have to read the card for each building individually. So you go to your first tailor and that will score 1+1 for each tailor in the 4 center squares. The next tailor will also score 1+1 for each tailor in the 4 center squares, and so on. You do that 8 times so 40 points.The rest is correct. But he counted wrong. He actually scores 47 points, not 44. I assume he forgot to count the 3 points for the Inn.

Original post: For 4 points, it doesn’t seem worth it to build this building, which will gimp you for the rest of the game. Since it is a large building (5 resources required), conventional wisdom suggests that it should be built early, which makes this building even more undesirable UNLESS it is used as part of another strategy (e.g. theatre).There are many other structures that will provide 4 points and does not have a negative side effect.

Response number 3:
It’s not always good, but in some setups it works well. it especially works well in town hall mode since you can count on all of the resources being called. I really like building them in cloister games since I won’t want yellows but I can burn two called yellows into it.

Sorry Josh,must be thick but I don’t understand”burn two yellows into it”?
Response number 7:
Bank requires two yellows to build (and three other resources). Cloisters use every resource except yellow, so when you are doing a mass Cloister strategy you tend to have extra yellow you don't want. A bank would also work well in a Cloister strategy since you can just make the color you can't call be yellow, which you would never call anyway while building Cloisters, so it wouldn't even be a handicap.

Original post: Hi Everyone. Someone on Reddit advised you might like my list of cube drafting variants using the cards!We really like Tiny Towns, but the cube drafting mechanic (either the base game or Town hall) can be hit or miss depending on the type of person you are and how tight/loose you like your game. You may prefer more direct interaction, or prefer a more solitaire experience too. My partner and I kept coming up with new variants on the cube selection mechanic every time we play. These are some of our favourites.They have only been tested at 2-player. Some will scale better than others.They are roughly ordered in simple – experimental. There are also some variants within variants!1. Cartographers Variant – (Solitaire) (scales to any player count) (smaller decision space)    • Discard 5 cube cards.     • Draw 2 cards face up to the table.     • Everyone chooses one of the two cards to place. Repeat until deck empty.     • Shuffle all cards back together, discard 5. Repeat. Small element of choice leading to drastically different towns. Cartographers Dice Variant 1 – Similar to above, however you roll a dice first! If it’s 1-3 	then you only draw 1 card for this turn – if it’s 4-6, then you draw 2 cards to choose from. Cartographers Dice Variant 2 – Same as above except – 1-2 draw one card, 3-4 draw 2 	cards, 5-6 draw 3 cards.2. The Small Market – (2 player) (Indirect interaction)    • Deal 3 cards face up to the middle of the table, with a draw pile to the side    • Player 1 picks a card    • Player 2 picks a card    • Remaining card(s) are discarded    • Instead of taking a card from the market, player may instead take the top card from the draw deck.    • The market is STILL refreshed entirely each round, even if 2 or both players decide to take a card from the draw deck. 3. The Large Market – (2 Player) – (slightly more Indirect interaction)    • Shuffle all 15 cards and deal 5 face up to the table    • Starting with player 1, snake draft. 1-2-2-1    • Discard remaining card    • Deal 5 more cards    • Starting with player 2 Snake draft 2-1-1-2 and discard remaining card    • Deal 5 remaining cards.     • Snake draft 1-2-2-1 again and discard remaining card    • Shuffle all cards including discarded    • Change first player. Repeat. Large market Variant – (not sure about this one yet)     • Similar to above, except discard 3 random cards at the start of the round    • Only deal 4 face up to the table    • Means the last person in a turn has to take the remaining card and doesn’t have two to choose from.4. The Biblios Variant – (2 player) (interactive)    • Shuffle cards and stack them    • On your turn, draw 3 cube cards from the pile    • Keep one     • Give one to your opponent    • Discard the third face up to a discard pile    • Next person goes. Repeat. Reshuffle deck once empty Allows some element of choice and ability to mess with your opponent. Discard pile allows you to see what won’t come back around until the deck is re-shuffled. Slight Biblios Variant – Same as above but:    • Discard card face down in a discard pile    • Opponent can choose to keep the card you gave them or swap for the (blind) discarded card.  Wild Biblios Variant – Same as Biblios but:    • Remove 5 cards each time you shuffle the deck. (So there are only 10)    • When you discard, you discard face down to the top of the draw pile.	Your opponent will then get that card in their next turn, and may end up passing it back to 	you.5. The Faction – (2 Player) (Asymmetric) (solitaire)    • Shuffle all 5 different cube cards and deal 1 to each player (so each person has a different card)    • This is your FACTION    • Keep this card, so you and the other player can see it. (This card is not in use for the rest of the game, and is just a reminder of your faction colour.)    • Shuffle the remaining 13 cards and discard 3 randomly (You will repeat this each time the draw deck is empty)    • Draw cards one at a time, face-up to the table. There are three possible turn-outs:1. If the card is YOUR faction colour – Use as a wild and choose any cube to place (note: there are only 2 cards of your faction in play as you have one representing your faction.)2. If it is your OPPONENTS faction colour – You MUST place this colour without exception.3. Any other colour cube is drawn – You can either chose to play the cube colour drawn, OR place your faction colour instead.This means you will be very strong in one particular colour, and your opponent strong in another. How you use your ‘wild’ ability can be very important.6. The Negotiator – (2 Player) (Highly interactive)    • Shuffle deck and remove 3 cards    • Create two stacks of 6 cards, one for each player    • Turn over the top card of your personal deck face-up. You have two options:1. Place the cube of the card drawn OR2. Request to swap your card with your opponents card – If you BOTH agree, then swap cards. If your decline, then you must place your original cube. If your opponent requests to swap then you can also decline or accept.This one was really fun! Do you refuse to trade that card you know they really want? If you do, will that mean they won’t trade with you when YOU need their card. Do you risk not trading in the hope that the cube you want is in your personal draw pile? The Negotiator – The alliance variant – (3 Player only) (VERY interactive)    • Create three random stacks of 5 cards. One for each player    • Each player turns over the top card of their stack at the same time    • You may place your cube,    • OR    • request to trade with either one of your opponents.     • You can only trade once per turn so that means only two of the three people will be able to swap cards.     • That means if you draw an orange that both other players want, you can choose who you trade with. Will the person you didn’t choose turn against you in the future?7. The 'Next up' Variant – (Any player count) (Solitaire)    • Shuffle deck and discard 5 cards (will be re-shuffled in when draw pile empty, and another 5    •  discarded)    • Create a draw pile    • Turn over the top card and place in the centre of the table. This is the current card.    • Turn over 2 more cards face up next to each other, to the right of draw pile    • These are the ‘upcoming’ cards    • Everyone places the current card cube colour.    • That card is moved to a discard pile    • The right most card is moved to the centre    • The 2nd face up card is moved along to replace it and a new card drawn from the deck to replace that oneBasically, you will always know what the next two cube cards are going to be.Whilst you have no ability to change the cards or select a colour, the knowledge of what’s coming can let you plan out ahead.You and your opponents get EXACTLY the same cards  Gentleman Queue variant	Removing cards from the deck can be risky, as there’s a chance certain colours will never show up, so instead:    • Same as above, but don’t remove any cards.     • Cycle the entire deck, then reshuffle.8. The Tetris hold – (2 Player, may work with more) (Solitaire)    • Shuffle 5 different cube cards and deal 1 to each player (so each person has a different card)     • Shuffle the remaining cards back into the deck    • This is your starting cube. Place it on the board    • KEEP the card in your ‘reserve’    • On your turn, deal one card face up to you and one to your opponent    • You have two options:    • 1. Place the cube you were just dealt    • 2. Swap the new card with your one in reserve and place that instead. The new card then becomes your reserve for future turns.	Therefore, you will always have a reserve card to choose from.Note: This does have the potential to unbalance, as each person getting dealt separately COULD lead to you never being dealt a particular colour (however is highly unlikely)9. The Swapper – (2 player)  (Interactive) (most complicated)This is quite hard to explain, but plays out quite simply and is really fun! Really worth the effort to learn this one.SETUP    • Deal 5 cards to each player. This is your hand. You are free to hold them like a deck of cards.    • Place the remaining 5 cards in a face-up market somewhere in front of you both, leaving a space in front. ON YOUR TURN    • This variant is split into 2 phases:     • Phase 1: The card selection phase – In this phase you have two options but can ONLY CHOOSE ONE.  Option 1 – Place a card 	You will select one card from your hand and place it face-up in the middle of the table.      (Your opponent will do the same, so there are two cards in the middle of the table.)    • Option 2 – Swap a card with one in the Market – Exchange any card in your hand for one in the market (This means you DO NOT PLACE A CARD THIS TURN, but you do get to place cube still in phase 2)NOTE: On the first turn of a round you can not access the market. There NEEDS to always be two cards to choose from. Phase 2: Choosing your cube      You can now pick a cube to place from the card either you OR your opponent played.    • Both players can pick the same, or different cards.Turn Ends - These cards are NOT discarded and stay where they are on the table.On all future turns in this round, when you choose to play a card you will play it ON TOP of EITHER of the previous turn’s cards. It doesn’t have to be the card you played. However, a card can not be placed over a card FROM THIS TURN (example: You play a card over card 2, if your opponent chooses to play a card this turn instead of using the market, they must play it over card 1.Example turn:On turn two, there will be two cards on the table already from turn 1. Lets say card (1) is BLUE and card (2) is BROWN.Player 1 chooses to play a card: They place an orange card ON TOP of the BROWN (2) card.Player 2 decides they really need a yellow wheat from the market so they choose to swap a grey in their hand for the yellow in the market.Phase 2 now beginsThe top two visible cards are now (1) BLUE (still blue from the first round as no one placed a card over it) and 2: ORANGE (as the orange was placed over the Brown in this round)Players then choose to place either a Blue or orange cube.Play then repeatsThe first player to play all cards in their hand can pick any card from the market to play until the second person has used all cards in their hand.At this point you collect all 15 cards, reshuffle and repeat set-upIt’s much simpler than it sounds, I promise!

Hi Mark, have you given up on this? I recently got this game and got very excited when I saw you were planning to create one of your automas for it. I already use a few of your other ones - they are great.

Hey Traci! I definitely haven’t given up on this. I just got burnt out on solo gaming in general and took the last two months off. With that said this will be the next Automa I complete so stay tuned!
Response number 4:
I fully understand the burn out. Games should never feel like a chore, and taking breaks is a good thing. If and when you do make it back to the world of solo gaming, here’s hoping it’s just as enjoyable for you as it was before.

Variants,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2204432/2-player-town-hall-variant-variant,"Title: 2-player Town Hall Variant variant
Original post: This is a variant of the Town Hall variant intended for 2-players to give a play experience closer to a 3 or 4 player game.In a 2-player game with the normal rules you get to choose every second cube - which lessens some of the placement angst compared to a 3 or 4 player game. But if you use the straight Town Hall variant then you completely lose the player interaction of choosing something which is good for you but bad for the other player. This variant tries to deliver something closer to an emulation of a 3 or 4 player game.Essentially the resource decks are used to emulate 1 or 2 dummy players rather than completely replacing the Master Builder action. This retains the interaction between players, while not giving the players control over every second cube.VariantThe resources cards are initially shuffled and drawn as per usual Town Hall variant, i.e., initially shuffle all cards and then discard the top 5 cards, and repeat whenever the last resource card is drawn.A ""round"" consists of: 1. Draw and play 1 resource card.2. Player 1 nominates a resource type.3. Player 2 nominates a resource type.This variant basically emulates a 3 player game.---[An alternative variant which emulates a 4 player game would be as follows:A ""round"" consists of: 1. Draw and play 1 resource card.2. Player 1 nominates a resource type.3. Draw and play 1 resource card.4. Player 2 nominates a resource type.This gives less overall resource control than the 3-player variant and has a more symmetric turn order.]

Original post: For 3 players:- Each player gets two boards- Each turn, instead of just one cube, a player takes two of the same coloured cube (by card or by someone's choice)- The player puts only one cube each on his two boards- Both cube must always be in different location to his other board- Each player gets two monument cards, each monument can only be built on one of the boards, once.- End game scoring is combined from the two boards.Works for 2 players as well with 2/3 boards & 2/3 monument cards per player.

Original post: I haven’t made up my mind yet whether to buy the expansion, but in the meantime I decided to try how the coins rule will work with the base game (so no extra cards with coins-related abilities). As I understood it, it is basically that you gain a coin if you build 2 or more buildings at the same time/on the same turn; then you can spend a coin to replace a resource  that was declared to another one. Each unused  coin scores you a point at the end of the game. I used some extra cubes for the coins.Basically, it worked pretty well and of course it makes the game easier because it allows you to develop your strategy without being too constrained by unwanted resources. In the beginning of the game it was usually possible to accumulate 3-4 coins, while at the later stages this is difficult because the limited space obliges you to build each building as soon as you have the resources in place.

Variants,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2217969/2-player-card-draw-variant,"Title: 2 player card draw variant
Original post: My proposal for a great 2 player experience: on each players turn they draw 2 cards. They then pick the resource they want and the other player gets the other. And so on. I think it adds a second choice layer on top of where you place the chosen resource. I felt it still had the oh darn moments of picking a single card but just enough power that it felt exciting to be able to choose your preferred resource of the two drawn on your turn. And it also means both players are going to get different resources and will possible be pursuing different resources at different times. Anyways I could go on. But we played it a whole lot over the past camping weekend. And it felt the most fun this way. Backstory of why we tried this. When I was first shown the game we played the standard way where each player picks a resource of their turn. Right I away I thought that it would be not the best way to play the 2 player game. But the single card shared draw for the resources also felt just slightly unsatisfying for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on so I thought easy change. Draw 2 pick 1 give the other.

Original post: I want to preface this by stating that not having a 5x5 grid printed on the back of the player boards was a missed opportunity. The backs are just blank. Maybe for the next print run?I haven't tried it myself yet, but I intend to play a 5x5 game solo tonight. I can use the 5x5 board in Tak or Santorini. I expect it to be great for a solo and 2p game. With more players I fear we'll encounter component shortages.I'll post some of my solo scores after I play a few times.

Variants,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2204846/more-forgiving-6-player-variant,"Title: More forgiving 6 player variant
Original post: With the standard rules, in a 6 player game you only get to choose 1 cube out of every 6, which might not be to everyone's preference. If you want a little more control at the larger player counts then you could elect to use the Town Hall variant, but this variant provides another idea ...VariantThe game is played as normal (with each player nominating a resource type on their turn) with the alteration that you always ignore the nomination of the player sitting directly opposite you and instead choose any resource type.This means you get to choose 1 in every 3 cubes - as per a 3 player game or Town Hall variant - but still retain the player interaction.
