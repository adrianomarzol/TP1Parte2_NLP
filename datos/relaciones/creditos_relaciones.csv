Pegasus Spiele,Descripcion,"Pegasus Spiele Verlags- und Medienvertriebsgesellschaft mbH, as the full name of the company goes, has been active since 1993 with its CEOs and owners Karsten Esser and Andreas Finkernagel in charge. Within the last decade, the German company has established itself not only as a distributor, but also as a publisher of successful board games - which is reflected in the ongoing series of prestigious nominations and awards. After nominations for the Spiel des Jahres in 2009 and 2010, as well as the nomination of “Strasbourg” for Kennerspiel des Jahres (expert game of the year) in 2011, the critically acclaimed “Village” by editorial partner eggertspiele was awarded Kennerspiel des Jahres 2012 and received the Deutscher Spielepreis (German Game Prize). In 2014 the jury Spiel des Jahres nominated three games simultaneously: The fast-paced family game “Camel Up” and the expert games “Istanbul” and “Rokoko”. Pegasus Spiele won both awards: “Camel Up” by editorial partner eggertspiele was awarded the Spiel des Jahres 2014, “Istanbul” won the Kennerspiel des Jahres 2014. In 2016, Pegasus Spiele was nominated for the Kinderspiel des Jahres (children’s game of the year) for the very first time with “Mmm!”. One year later, Pegasus Spiele received a double nomination for the Spiel des Jahres with “Kingdomino” and “Magic Maze” – and took the award home a second time with “Kingdomino”. At the same time, the publisher appeared on the recommendations list both for the Kinderspiel and for the Kennerspiel des Jahres.
With more than 5.000 games and toys distributed through strong trading partners, Pegasus Spiele is also known as a successful distributor. This includes numerous own brands with innovative board games like “Junta” and “The Dwarves” as well as cult card game series such as “Munchkin” and “Smash Up”. A network of 250 voluntary demonstrators assists the publishing company at fairs, conventions and events throughout German-speaking Europe in presenting its products – such as the popular team game “Captain Sonar” and the export hit “Port Royal”. Dozens of freelancers and 30 permanent employees work at the headquarters in Friedberg, near Frankfurt am Main, on creating great gaming experiences.
Pegasus Spiele is the official distributor of all German Portal Games products. Exclusively included in Pegasus Spiele’s portfolio are the inventive games of Matagot, Steve Jackson Games and White Goblin Games as well as a selection of Frosted Games titles. Furthermore, the company also distributes many exceptional game publishers like Abacus Spiele (“Hanabi”), MeterMorphosen (“Gemischtes Doppel”), Kylskapspoesi (“Gesprächsstoff”), Moses Verlag (“Black Stories”), Blaubart Verlag (“Mörderische Dinnerparty”), Adlung Spiele (“Teamwork”) and Wizkids (“Hero Clix”).

Tiny Towns,Mechanisms,Player Elimination
Player Elimination,Descripcion,"A player can be removed from the game, no longer participating.
In some such games, all of an eliminated player's material is removed from the game as well; in other such games this material may remain in play as neutral material. (E.g. an eliminated player's armies and cities on a map might disappear, or might be become neutral armies and cities.)
In most games, an eliminated player cannot win, but this is not necessarily true. (E.g. in some games with victory based on scores, an eliminated player's score is still eligible for victory.)
In most games with player elimination, a player is eliminated involuntarily. But in some games a player can choose to drop out (with hope that their score suffices to win (e.g. Wooly Wars).
In some games, player elimination is possible, but rare in practice and does not happen in a ""typical session"" (e.g. Age of Steam).
In some games, player elimination is common. In the extreme case, all players but one (the sole surviver = eventual winner) are eliminated during a session (e.g. Titan). In many player elimination games, typically some players are eliminated but multiple other players are not (e.g. Werewolf and BANG!).
Player elimination does not include two-player-only games where the goal is to defeat the opponent, e.g., Chess.

Using Puerto Rico as an example, every turn is different. Depending on who starts selecting the roles and what roles they take, you may have to play the 'build' action sooner than you'd wish. In other games, you may be denied from taking certain action.
Most games with limited action and any game without a static game turn order fall under this 'mechanism'. Use of variable player turn order are not Variable Phase Order games."

Variable Player Powers,Descripcion,"Variable Player Powers is a mechanic that grants different abilities and/or paths to victory to the players. To illustrate, here are some notable examples.
In Ogre, one player controls a single powerful piece, and the other plays many weaker units. The net effect is a balanced game.
In Cosmic Encounter, each player is assigned a random special ability at the beginning of the game. Although each player has the same victory goal (establish colonies on five planets in other players' systems), their abilities enable differing means to the end.
In Here I Stand, each player controls a political power with unique ways to score victory points. Some focus on military conquest, some on religious influence, etc.
Player powers may change throughout the game, as in Small World or Sunrise City."
